So I've to detail about it. I've used other app, but this one very strategic, effective, simple and moreover very easy to use. If you don't want a widget in your home screen, you can simply access it in the notification panel, and that's very thoughtful. Add some more features like coloured region, small popup icon reminder, different widgets. Thank you for the minimum ads.","109 people found this review helpful","tact","December 5, 2019","Hello sajeesh,you're welcome, thank you so much for fantastic feedback, about your suggestions, I just added it on the next version of this app,its currently on beta, and it will be released soon, best regards"

I originally gave this app just 3 stars because I was unhappy that it forced me to hit the repeat button rather than the done button when completing a repeating task in order to make it continue repeating. With small fonts, poor eyesight and fat fingers, bumping the wrong button deleted my task completely. However, the developer responded to my review and pointed out that I could change that behavior in the app settings. A developer that cares and an app that gets the job done. I'm now giving the app 5 stars.

Shows and I don't know what was that!!! And another important thing it does not sort by nearest due time to latest, another suggestion is reminder by specefic location and the ability to attach files I appreciate if you consider them in the next version.","27 people found this review helpful","tact","March 7, 2021","Hello Mohsen, I'll consider your notes and suggestions in the next version of this app, thanks a lot for your great help, I appreciate it."

It's robust enough to get things done, without any complications. Integration with Google Tasks a definite plus. There's just one issue. ⁣ Could you please add a sorting function? I find that when synchronizing with Google Tasks the ""subtasks"" transfer out of order, voiding the app's ""subtask"" function. THANK YOU!","33 people found this review helpful","","",""

I set up multiple lists for different seasons when I use an app like this one so I need to turn off the winter list/schedule and turn on the spring one soon. Ps -I'm switching to this instead of TimeTune because their latest update killed it for offline use so now it sucks. This Simple Plan to do app is way better.","7 people found this review helpful","tact","February 15, 2020","Hello, I'll add your suggestion on future release, thank you so much for your kind feedback"

They are all standalone. Kind of defeating the purpose as I rely heavily on Google calendar. This is the only app that allow me to sync to Google calender. My problem solved. It also allow setting of dark mode. Just what I need. I don't mind paying for a paid version for a job well done...","64 people found this review helpful","tact","March 19, 2021","Hi Wyko, thanks for the nice feedback, and I'm working to add a paid version without ads in a future release of this app. By the way, this app currently shows only small ads at screen bottom and doesn't show any pop-up ads for more information about ads please refer to the app privacy policy, you can access it from app settings. Happy organizing :)"
