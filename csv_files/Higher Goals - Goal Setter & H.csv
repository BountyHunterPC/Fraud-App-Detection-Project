But when you consider the functionality with the price point, lot of other apps beat this one by a good margin. Either bring the price down or introduce enough features to distinguish yourself to justify the price. Edit: I do hope you will add the option to enable/disable north star, goals and habits. I use just the goals feature right now, so disabling the others would be convenient.","57 people found this review helpful","Mindful Suite","July 30, 2020","Hey thanks for the kind words. Yes we are actively working on the improvement. Unlike many other apps that haven't been updated for years, we ship surprise every month to delight our customers. We'll also adjust the price based on currency to be more accessible. We are studying the right prices."

Also a journal component would be amazing, if we could write about our plans and goals, in a journal on the app that would be fantastic. Another great to add could be a Monday to Sunday timetable, so time could be scheduled for habits and activities.","8 people found this review helpful","","",""

I wanted something that could track daily, weekly (1x or multiple times per week), and monthly habits as well as annual goals. Most apps don't track monthly tasks or if they do then the task is due on a certain day that month instead of getting it done within that month. This app has what I wants and also keeps track of annual goals and % complete! A bar fills up to show that I have read 3 of 30 books this year, for instance.","20 people found this review helpful","Mindful Suite","February 14, 2020","Thank you, Amber. How you use the app inspires us and you explained it better than we could. Indeed, habits are weekly goals, north stars are life goals, and other goals fall in the middle. We are glad that we are the first app that sees this fact and let people track all of them in one place. We wish you a great 2020!"

But there are also things which need to be fixed (on my phone, at least). For instance, it freezes up and becomes unresponsive every few minutes, and needs to be restarted. The rotating banner takes up too much space (that could be better used showing more goals). Some of the text/numbers on some screens gets cut-off. Sometimes when you're editing a parameter, it doesn't save/stick. Finally, the price perhaps too high. But even with flaws, it's still a solid four out of five.

Better than habitica and the others. I needed something simple but with a easy to use UI. It needs more features however. Like family goal, habit and todo list. This could grow into that.

Has Dream Goals/Mindset reminder at top. Also its clear and easy to use. Very user friendly. Very visual. I was thinking maybe a vision board could be added at the top scroll bar as visuals communicate better with the subconscious mind and creates an imprint of future self. Also when the goals deadlines goes to a certain percentage eg. 5 days left out of 20 days (25%) they could change colour to alert you when it's critical. Eg.
