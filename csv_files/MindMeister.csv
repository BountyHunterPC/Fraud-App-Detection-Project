The app experience is inconsistent on slow connections. For example, creating a new topic would not reflect until a long time. Something like a loading bar would be great to show that the request is still processing. Since there's no feedback, I tap on the ""new topic"" button repeatedly and after some time (after all the requests go through) I see several empty placeholder topics. Also the UX could be bit more intuitive.","120 people found this review helpful","","",""

The map on ipad shows the data is present but doesn't get sync even with good internet connectivity for 15 days. I have to redo 15 hours worth data which is brainstorming again because of this!

Whenever I try to move a subtopic it will disconnect from the parent topic and connect to the central topic. It will only reconnect to the correct topic in a specific place making it impossible to arrange subtopics in a different order or to fix overlapping topics or messy layouts. Extremely frustrating.","1 person found this review helpful","MeisterLabs","October 26, 2022","Hi Kasey, thanks for reaching out.

It was difficult to use, and provided very little creativity or free organization. Things won't seem to connect the way you want them to, if you try to move a piece around it will likely disconnect from its current parent and try to re-parent itself. Plus the default positions are really packed together. Overall it seems to lack a lot of what makes a flowchart useful.

Most people will be happier dealing with a few ads than having to directly pay for basic features. I'd planned on organizing personal writing projects with this app, and since I'm a visual artist as well I'd have photos attached. Sadly, that isn't possible for me.","27 people found this review helpful","MeisterLabs","August 27, 2021","Hello! Thanks for reaching out with your feedback.

It works as described but the problem is with customer service. I paid for premium and signed up for one year But canceled it so it would not auto renew... The cancellation did not go through for some reason So it automatically billed me for another year. The day after I was billed I sent in a request for refund explaining this ... but they basically said ""sorry, too bad"".","71 people found this review helpful","MeisterLabs","July 13, 2021","Hi Jesse, sorry to hear you were disappointed with our billing practices. Unfortunately, we cannot manage your Google Play subscriptions from our end, and granting a refund outside our policy limits would put all our other users at a disadvantage. Our apologies once again; we hope for your understanding.
