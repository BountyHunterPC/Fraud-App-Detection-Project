On the one hand, the black icons are excellent and look great. On the other hand, it doesn't have icons for every app (naturally). And the contrast between normal colored icons and these icons is just too jarring. It becomes pretty much unusable because of this. I uninstalled the icon pack after 10 minutes.","87 people found this review helpful"

The aesthetics are on another level altogether and the adaptation for apps not originally part of the pack is incredibly consistent and thoughtful. Thank you for sharing your talent with the rest of us and making our screens look more beautiful than before!","78 people found this review helpful"

But the problem is when I change the default app icon given by this app, after a while it will change to something completely different and unrelated. This happens randomly and yeah, it's an annoying bug. But other than that, the included wallpapers is a nice touch, there are little no ads inside the app, and it's easy to use. I am willing to change my review as soon as they fix it :)","95 people found this review helpful"

Yes, it may be a bit difficult to see at times, especially with dark wallpapers (i have bing daily as my wallpaper, so it changes every day), but overall it's way better than the standard look. It turnes my mobile desktop from a chaotic mess into a neat and consistent masterpiece. An idea for another icon pack is to be like this but have white borders, so that they are consantly visible, and neat.","31 people found this review helpful"

But once everything is set up, the phone looks simply great. As for the request, it might be useful to put a line in the Help mentioning that you have to choose email once the bundle is ready, it confused me for a while.","71 people found this review helpful"
