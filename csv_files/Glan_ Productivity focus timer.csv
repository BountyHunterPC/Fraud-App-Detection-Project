But there are somethings that need to be changed. First of all, if you start an 60m, and complete the task within 55m and you end the session, then all your progress goes away and it isn't tracked. You have to complete the pomodoro. Secondly, when you complete the task, you cannot edit it. If you click on done by mistake, you cannot undo it. You will have to redo it. That's all. Please make the changes asap","91 people found this review helpful",""

It has a really aesthetic feel to it, which I really love. I'm looking for the dark mode and it does not seem to be available in this app. Also, the screen doesn't stay awake while the timer is ongoing. Lastly, you can't stop the timer midway and if you do, this progress is not counted. If these 3 problems of mine are solved, this app is going to be super perfect. ü™ê","18 people found this review helpful",""

It looks really calming and I love the audio. Although I wish it has repeating task option so that I don't have to write them down every single day. One more problem is that it won't save your stats if you stop halfway through but that's not a really big issue for me, it is a little annoying sometimes when I finish my task early and it doesn't save. I see a lot of potential on this app, so I will keep on using it for now.","2 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

I really do, from the aesthetic feel, the automatic breaks and the todo list, it's a really good app. But I'm only giving three stars for now because there is much room for imrpovement. We should be able to edit/delete a task, and it would also be nice to be able to set a goal time for each task. It would also be nice to see a history of completed tasks because that can give a sense of accomplishment","40 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It glitches sometimes. I don't that if I skip the break multiple times, the next time the work period cycles, I don't get a break. Sometimes, the app does not notify me when the work period is over, even if it is running. I also wish there was the option to add tasks while the timer is running, sometimes tasks pop up throughout the day and I don't want to restart the timer everytime I want to add a new task.","24 people found this review helpful",""

The aesthetic is great, the clock doesn't fluctuate when I leave the app temporarily, it gives you steps to focus, there are sounds on it that makes it easier to concentrate. Best app for productivity out there and I have had my fair share of failures. Keep it up. And the ads are not overbearing. I would like to however make a suggestion to have a dark mode and to also have something to distract people less while on their phone.","38 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

A couple options that might be nice is a way to repeat tasks daily or weekly or something, & also the option to stop the timer part way through. The lowest setting is 20 minutes, but sometimes I finish the task in less than 20 minutes. But if you back out or stop the timer, it just resets & you lose that progress & it's not recorded in stats. Also an option to add time manually if I forgot to start the timer would be really nice.","28 people found this review helpful",""

I love that there's a built in timer. Could you make it so that swiping right marks it as complete and left as remove instead of both directions being remove?

The buttons are too close to each other, the pause/resume button has basically stuck below the circular time progress.

For potential future features, I would love to see one or two clock sounds in the white noise list, for those who want that Pomodoro studious vibe. A low pitch slow clock sound would be incredible, and make this app worth 10 stars! Thank you for this perfect app!","8 people found this review helpful",""

I like the simple yet effective layout and colour scheme. Very motivating. Includes some gentle white noises for every situation. You can prioritize and colour code tasks. I really appreciate this app and the fact that it is free! One thing I would suggest is that you can recurr tasks so that you don't need to keep setting the same tasks so often. Overall, a great minimalistic productivity app I highly recommend!","4 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Very intuitive, the UI is just pure calm and aesthetically pleasing which is great to relax yourself before the work begins. However, I would like to customize my work time more (such as 90 minutes) I think 90 minutes or 120 minutes tops before a long break is great and could be use for some people üòÉ.
