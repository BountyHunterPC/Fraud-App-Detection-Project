There simply isn't, as far as I am aware, another icon pack as comprehensive as this one that is also free. I have two minor issues though. First, personally, I find a lot of the icons can be rather similar. There's a lot of boxy icons with little color variation, some of them just ignoring the color of the original (T-mobile). Second, I use SwiftKey and the keyboard will not appear initially when I use the search feature. I have to tap the caret to make the keyboard appear.","10 people found this review helpful","Leif Niemczik","October 13, 2022","Hi! Thank you for the kind words! Your feedback is appreciated. I will go ahead and fix T-Mobile icon color. As for the similar icons, we do use the same palette for consistency purpose and often pick square and circle icons shapes by default. We tend to go free form when the icon looks better that way. I'll look into the keyboard issue."

I love that each update you can request new addons altho not all are quick to include (I understand more popular apps get added before, so I'm not mad); I wish there was a way to requests alternatives, since ex. arcaea icon is too distinct from my other icons. also maybe have a filter related to colour/shape as I use ambiguous-looking icons on apps that haven't been added yet. just my 5 cents though, and maybe not all users think like me!","","Leif Niemczik","November 19, 2022","Hi, feel free to request alternatives or report outdated icons by sending a bugs report through the app; this is the best way as of now. As for filter I'm guessing you mean new tabs in the icons page.. that could be done although it would be a mess to manage and require more of our time so less for actual icons creation unfortunately."

I've seen icons for some games but never seen one for Arknights which is my favorite mobile game. Also, you have icons for every app that I use regularly (this includes apps like Instander, Tachiyomi, ReadEra premium) which are not very well known so you really deserve 5 stars. I just found out you have an icon even for Summertime Saga.","1 person found this review helpful","","",""

However I can't recommend it at the moment as more than a handful of times I've updated the app and pretty much every icon is wrong. This is currently the case for me, hence 1 star. At this moment in time, the app is fundamentally broken. Response to Dev feedback: Thanks for responding to the review, for what's it's worth, I already cleared the app cache and reinstalled the app completely. Unfortunately the problem persists.","22 people found this review helpful","Leif Niemczik","July 15, 2022","Icons should no longer be applied randomly after each update as we removed a feature that most likely was causing the issue on Oppo's phones. We apologize for the inconvenience and invite you to clear app data/cache before re-applying Delta. Following updates should be fine."

The colours are carefully chosen, they really work well together and make every icon aesthetically pleasing. There are many icons to choose from so thankfully I didn't have any problems finding a substitute for a missing one. Although I wish there was an option to request a few problematic ones.

The biggest mobile phone provider in the UK, yet you've got Vodafone & O2, which have about half the customer base of EE! I share data amongst my family so the EE app sits right on my home screen. Not having it themed totally spoils the aesthetic so can't use this pack. I refuse to believe it hasn't already been requested by plenty of others.","10 people found this review helpful","Leif Niemczik","June 28, 2022","We're not always adding icons due to their popularity. Vodafone was added on 1.1.0 as the creator of this app probably use it (or used to) and a contributor added o2 later on, perhaps for the same reason. That's one of the priviledges of contributing to this project. A kind email would've resolved this issue; you can request the icon instead."

Some icons are square, some are rectangular, and some are other shapes entirely (Google Play is just a triangle, OneDrive is a cloud, etc).
