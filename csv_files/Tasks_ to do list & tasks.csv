There are two things that I would suggest: 1. Making the calendar available as a widget. 2. Making it so that you can schedule a time that a task ""activates""/shows up on your list. Maybe with a toggle for showing future tasks, like how you can select whether or not to show completed tasks. This would be good for reoccurring tasks especially.","22 people found this review helpful","","",""

Through the use of multiple tags and filtered lists you can use Getting Things Done AND the Eisenhower Matrix, and probably most other systems you like. You can make your entries complex enough to cover all the details, and finding and sorting your material is simple and fast. I am impressed by the flexibility. There are training videos too!","13 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","November 4, 2022","Hi Kathryn, so nice to hear how my little app is helping you.

Color coding and sub lists are great for making things less overwhelming. Sorting by age helps keep things from falling down the cracks. Customized notification times/dates make this great for chores as well as to do lists. The new snooze change works well with holidays. This app is helping in big ways.

It does let me share the lists with him and send it to him in a SMS message BUT it doesn't look like it does on the app and you can't check the items off like you can in the actual app. I heard that if we were paying for this app that it offers that feature. Not totally sure though. Regardless, great app!","1 person found this review helpful","","",""

Update after a few months: I'm not sure I've ever reviewed something twice unprompted, but honestly, I'm impressed with how intuitive and full-featured this is - whenever I want to do something more complex with my lists, the option to do so is basically always in the first place I think to check. It's really gratifying that these things were already thought of and implemented.","","Pocket Brilliance Limited","May 30, 2022","You're welcome Patrick, thank you so much for supporting for my little app. Cheers, Steve"

Being able to set alarms for tasks instead of notifications means I never miss appointments anymore and is invaluable! I wanted to support the developer, but damn the subscription cost and one time fee are high. Half the price and I would consider buying the lifetime licence, a quarter of the cost and I would have bought without even thinking about it, but the current price is just too expensive for me.","6 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","October 29, 2022","Hi Ryan, thanks you so much for your support for my little app. Lifetime does mean forever. Unfortunately servers, storage etc. around the world are expensive. Google takes 30% of any transaction + taxes etc. In reality I can already lose money on the lifetime option. There are cheaper payment options or a donation (main menu). Cheers, Steve"

Currently you can only move them to the top and bottom of the list. But for sorting the tasks based on their priority it is not enough. Moving them as you see it it fit by pressing on them would be a good feature.

Would recommend at least making that information easier to find. Maybe it's available somewhere but I checked as carefully as I could and only found out when I shared the link. If there was some kind of family plan style cost where the main user covers costs it wouldn't be so bad.","3 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","October 26, 2022","I don't hide the info.

I made a ""daily to do list"" list and sub-listed each day of this month and add things to my week as I have time. If I don't get to them, into the next day or goes but it's so satisfying checking things off. I made a widget on my home screen and it's easy to swap out each day right from your home screen.

The random extra features (highlighting tasks, sublists, filters, etc) are awesome! The only thing keeping me from switching to this app is that I need the ability to add due dates to subtasks.

Flexible and slightly fun, but not fun enough that the list making keeps me from doing something. Color coding is great. I know I haven't explored all the variations yet, so for every time I wish it did something, I look, and it does do that thing. I like it well enough I paid for the premium version and it's better still. Only one thing: it seems like you can't backdate a task/completion, which would help with record keeping. If I'm wrong on that, help?","12 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","October 15, 2022","Hi Betsy, thank you so much for your fantastic support for my little app. To change the completion date simply tap on it from a tasks detail screen.

The only thing that would make it better is if there was a desktop version. This app has helped me not only keep track of my to-do's in a super easy and quick way, but to get the time-sensitive tasks done on-time with reminders. The best thing about the reminders is that they are fully custom - so you can set reminders for odd times and repeat patterns. An absolutely great app.","42 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","September 26, 2022","Hi Jeremy, thank you for your wonderful support for my app. Your wish is my command.

Also, a way to cross-reference lists would be neat. For example, a list of chores might include to buy groceries. That item would then link to a separate list that contained the actual items to but.","27 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","September 3, 2022","Hi Andrew, some great feedback & support. If you need more than 4 levels of hierarchy (lists, sub lists, tasks, & sub tasks) your items are probably too big and need to be split higher up. Cross referencing already exists.

Thanks so much! Original review- I love this app! It's amazing for keeping lists and keeping organised. The only negative thing I have to say is I wish there was an option to add images into the list items. Otherwise it is perfect!","2 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","September 19, 2022","Hi Katrina, you're welcome.

I used TickTick for years, which is still a great app, but the ability to have notifications be set as an alarm is super helpful to me. One thing I'd like to see is for when the notification is set as type alarm is to be able to go directly to the notification or mark as done from the alarm screen. Another thing that I would like to see is the ability to change the due date directly from the snooze screen. Other than that I love this app so far!","","Pocket Brilliance Limited","October 19, 2022","Hi Braydn, great feedback and support for my little app. Thank you.

Each list can be broken into sublists, and the tasks themselves can be as simple or as detailed as I would like. Very satisfying to cross things off, and this app has been so helpful for getting my life just a bit more organized. Thank you!","","Pocket Brilliance Limited","October 20, 2022","You're welcome Jillian.It's so nice to hear how my little app is helping you.

Life is hectic, I love anything that simplifies it.","2 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","October 18, 2022","Wow! Amazing feedback Peekamoo for my little hobby project.

I have used it for so many things from lists to to-do items to project organization! Super simple, super clean, super easy to use, super flexible! I recommend throwing the developer some change if you can, since even the free version doesn't bombard you with ads!","2 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","September 5, 2022","Wow!

D.","Show review history","September 15, 2022","What's missing is a function to group lists into a bigger topic. Sublists are not always sufficient because I need all functions like color and sublists in these too. Best would be an option to integrate list into each other without disloving the structure like the ranking and still let them have their dedicated topic name. Other than that, the most customisable app I found out of 10 I tried. The only one suiting my own life and organizing style and not trying to push a habit system on me.","2 people found this review helpful","Pocket Brilliance Limited","September 19, 2022","Hi, I'm not really sure I understand? My app already has lists, sub lists, tasks & sub tasks. It sounds like you just mean lists. Please email with me more details. In the meantime, I hope there are 5 features of my advert free, hobby project you do like and you can show your full support. Stars are free after all and it really helps. Cheers, Steve"

I can quickly make a new list and add a task. It has an option to add pics, notes, subtasks... Literatly everything I need. I also love how I'm able to personalize each list by naming it and choosing a color scheme. Fantastic app! Thanks so much!","","Pocket Brilliance Limited","September 19, 2022","You're welcome Stevi.
