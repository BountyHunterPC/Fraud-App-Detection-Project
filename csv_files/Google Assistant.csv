It answers my question and then when I go to so other app after that, it repeats the answer.....even when it's not in the recently opened apps view. This single bug is annoying me a lot. Otherwise it's just perfect. I use it very extensively and love it a lot.

The app is compromising device security. Many OSs disable quick settings access on lockscreen for security reasons. But Google assistant can disable data, wifi and Bluetooth from lockscreen with a voice command. Even though it responds to owner's voice only, voice can be easily mimicked. To prevent this, we have to disable assistant on lockscreen, then we will lose other functionality as well. So it will be better if there's a option to prevent this.","1,329 people found this review helpful","","",""

I only have American English as the language I use and speak to the Google Assistant and I have restarted my Google Pixel 6A but it still does not work. I heard back right away from the developer on ways to possibly fix my situation. I will try them and let you know how it goes.","13 people found this review helpful","Google LLC","September 23, 2022","Thanks for your review, Charles!

Android auto was effective, clean and easy to use whilst driving. Google assistant cannot understand simple instructions and keeps making unprompted mistakes (playing messages and podcasts that I haven't asked for). This makes it distracting and dangerous. Most people do not have cars with screens and do not want to pay the android auto license fee.","41 people found this review helpful","","",""

Tells me contacts don't exist but somehow it still knows their names. Will open when prompted and listen to command but never actually perform the request. Very very disappointed right now. Please fix this issue. Only feature that works right now is setting a timer. AND the contact email on this page is no longer monitored so contacting the developer is a nightmare. Unacceptable!","1 person found this review helpful","","",""

It completely stopped responding or opening for the 2nd time in two weeks even after reinstalls and updates. Not worth the effort when I can do it myself.","","Google LLC","November 19, 2022","Hi Nancie. Thanks for reporting this issue.

Whenever navigating on Maps it pops up & won't go away easily; it takes over my music app & phonecalls, clicking private calls over to speaker-phone without notice; damn near crashed into a parked car swerving around while trying to forcestop it & silence a private call in a car full of co-workers one time.","3 people found this review helpful","Google LLC","November 2, 2022","Hi David, thanks for sharing your feedback with us.
