The biggest issue is a bug that the setting for the default music player always defaults to the highlighted player, even if the toggle is set to Off. The devs need to fix that and it would be perfect.","October 28, 2022","Thank you for reporting the problem, we will work to fix it.",""

A slight resizing (or placement change) of the volume up/down icons needed. Reasonable pricing to purchases additional skins.

However when I actually use the widgets they come out misshapen and just outright ugly compared to the pictures provided, the radius controls do not give any insight into whether that is the problem or whether it requires resizing my launcher doesn't offer? This may just be a personal problem and if so, is a great music widget","July 19, 2022","Hello. We are sorry for your bad experience with our app, you can try to use another launcher.

My only complaint so far is that, on Musicolet, the cover art is very pixelated. It will start out crisp and clear, then, a split second later, pixelated. Spotify looks fine though. Hence why the two stars","July 2, 2022","We are sorry for your bad experience with our application. Thank you for reporting the problem.
