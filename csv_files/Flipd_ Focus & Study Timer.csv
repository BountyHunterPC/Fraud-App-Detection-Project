Multitasking mode is great but does not work everytime( while taking a break by pausing the app when the multitask button is on, if you have to use another app in this period you might feel disappointed after switching back to Flipd). Worst part is recently it is not saving the study time. In addition to the previous version had 1hour sessions which is a terrible missing in the new one.","14 people found this review helpful","","","",""

But it lacks 1. user customizable app whitelisting. 2. Automatically start on scheduled time. I think these two features are important for the app. Also, as it works in the subscription model, it would be better to get these features rolled out at the earliest as it might be easy to lose customer base.","86 people found this review helpful","Flipd Inc.","April 29, 2020","Hey Preethi, thanks for taking the time to leave a review.

The timer stops midway automatically and the progress is lost too which defeats the whole purpose. The app has lesser and no new features like work with a friend, as compared to the iOS app even after buying their premium service. Problem still remains after the update. The times stops automatically and the progress is lost. And additional features are still missing.","25 people found this review helpful","Flipd Inc.","June 30, 2021","Hi Himanshu, thanks for your review and I'm sorry for the trouble!

It force shuts you out of your phone. Literally! The only thing Is.. there actually is a way for you to close the app and exit the force shut, but only if you're fast enough before it shuts you out of the previous apps opened screen as well. The app will be a total beast once this bug is fixed! Rating it a well deserved 4 star. Only wish the white list could be customizable. Do that and Flipd will be untouched by other apps.","14 people found this review helpful","Flipd Inc.","February 4, 2020","Thanks Miks03  for the kind words and feedback.

However, it sometimes stops working midway, meaning that the countdown suddenly stops and I am able to access all my apps and even delete Flipd.

Well created. Id like to bring to your notice that the time the app takes to lock the screen once minimized is sufficient to uninstall it. Since i know this, it takes a little extra effort to stay off my phone. All I would have to do is minimize, quickly uninstall, use my phone instead of studying and reinstall afterwards. It would be great if you could probably reduce the recovery time of the lock so I'd be locked out for the selected period.","7 people found this review helpful","Flipd Inc.","October 7, 2019","Hey Ankita, we're so happy to hear you enjoy using Flipd!

It was a place just for me and now the entire interface is so social media-istic, I simply hate it. The old flipd was supposed to be for me and just for me, and now all the 'just for me' features are locked for premium and the entire thing is 'community' based. This was supposed to be an escape and now it's neither peaceful nor mindful. It's hectic like any other mind- draining app.","17 people found this review helpful","Flipd Inc.","August 27, 2020","Hi Aditi, thanks for your feedback and taking time to leave this review!

However it's become unusable recently because of a major bug.   1) The full lock countdown isn't working properly. e.g. every time I set a 6hr time lock before sleeping the countdown pauses at some point. So when I wake up 8 hrs later there's still 4 hrs on the countdown etc.   This is seriously annoying! My phone is locked right now ...   2) Not a bug but a feature request. Flipd in their FAQ's say it isn't possible to allow users to make their own personal whitelist of apps due to tech constraints. However, for Android at least this is not true.   I have several other competing apps that allow me to do just this.   The idea that it's better for Flipd to only provide a short list of whitelisted apps is shortsighted to say the least. Every User is different, certain apps are only useful in certain countries etc. Please change this so you can provide a decent user experience.    I for one won't be renewing my subscription until I see these improvements. It's a great app, just needs significant upgrades.","11 people found this review helpful","","","",""
