It offers less features than the website overall, and unlike other applications, it forcibly captures ALL github links without offering to go to Chrome first. Actually opening the website on Chrome is a challenge now. BUT I can't uninstall it if I want to keep the two factor token it provides. I hate it.","22 people found this review helpful",""

But what is there works without any flaw. I would really appreciate an overview over the github actions and at least a simplified kanban board. As soon as the mobile app reaches a greater feature set, I'll be happy to give more stars. TLDR quality software but still limited features","5 people found this review helpful",""

That is missing Second, There is clearly an api issue. I have a triage role in org, but in app I cannot even change a label due to permission error. I have to open mobile browser to do that.

Missing functionality, buttons, cannot share code, deeplink, highlight lines, navigate easily. Oftentimes I got stuck in the app, with the back not putting me back to where I was. Automatic capturing of GitHub links means that I can't escape the app even in situations I know can't use it. Please make the app open-source!","111 people found this review helpful",""

Hard to find anything, no obvious way to change an issues category within a project, things aren't where you expect them to be or just flat out can't be changed. Others might have a fine experience but I did not, sorry devs!
