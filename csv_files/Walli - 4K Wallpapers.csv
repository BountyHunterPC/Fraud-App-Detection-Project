Bringing all the designers from around the world into one place. I found many creative designs, illustrations and photos from this. The quality of the image is so good. The one flaw that i found is there is no search option, couldn't type the keywords and filter it easily. Could you please fix it. Overall it's a best app to get creative images.","321 people found this review helpful","","",""

It's not only a treasure trove of amazing wallpapers but is also a platform for artists to portray their works and express themselves. You can have any number of wallpapers in your playlist, you just will have to watch an ad after 10, or you could upgrade. Honestly, I don't find the ads that annoying because they're pretty short. And the artwork is really stunning. It's like an Instagram for wallpapers (you can like photos and follow your favourite artists).","257 people found this review helpful","","",""

Fell in love with the collections! Lots of artists are there, their artworks are sooo damn good! I just can't express how much lucky I am to found this gold. Some improvements are needed in terms of functionality like, 1. Multiple playlists, 2. Rather than removing artworks from playlist 1 by 1, I wish there's an option for selecting multiple files, 3. Frequency can be brought down to seconds like 30 secs.","178 people found this review helpful","","",""

Please add an option or category where I could find all the artworks from all the artists I am following together. Right now I could only visit their profiles to get it but it if all the followed artist's artworks are available at a single place in any sequence it would be great. 2. I so wish to find pitch black dark mode being available. It would make the experience superb.","3 people found this review helpful","","",""

Please either keep the 3 dots in a more reachable location like above the artist image, or add a button for quickly adding an artwork to a playlist.

It's understandable and very cool. To elaborate, what it does is if you like a particular photo then converts and previews it as a wallpaper that is normal.
