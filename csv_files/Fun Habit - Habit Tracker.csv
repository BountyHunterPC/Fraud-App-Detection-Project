It is the only one that has all the features that I need. I love the interface, it's very easy to use and see. Just what's required with minimum fuss, no complications, and nearly everything has been thought of. A very reasonable yearly payment too, though the free version is also enough. I also get quick responses to any question from the developer. Well done and thank you!","18 people found this review helpful","","",""

Reward = 1 & Range = 100 gave me both 0.59 and 1.91. I don't understand. I just want a simple range of 20-35 coins for example. Other feedback: 1. The ""Set Habit Type"" option disappears. To change from ""Repeat"" to ""Single"" I have to make a new habit, disrupting my data. 2. I can't disable ""Timer"" in ""Custom Modules"". 3. Please add a duplicate habit/wish function. 4. I wish you could long-press then slide to edit habits. Thanks so much!","","SimiDev","September 26, 2022","Hello, the random range of 100% means that the final amount obtained is -100% to +100%. Once a habit is created, it is not possible to change the single/repeat  type, because changing the type may cause statistical distortions, so it is prohibited.Other problems will be fixed or considered as soon as possible. Thank you for your advice"

The app is working great and despite the learning curve, its powerful and very customizable. Pros: a functional widget you can check your habits off and see number of days completed, customizable reward system, affordable one time premium fee (RM 18+), easy tutorials, not many ads. Cons: undo tick for a habit is a bit tedious. This is the best habits app with a flexible rewards and punishments system.","4 people found this review helpful","","",""

First would be, they could add that calendar streak feature, expand their icon collection (more study icons please), separate the notifications of this app from the phone's own calendar (my phone calendar was already a bit full with my schoolwork due dates, etc and got too crowded when this app's notifications were added to it), and for the custom frequency, please let us specify the date ü•∫","11 people found this review helpful","","",""

But the incentive for trying to complete more tasks in the day would be highly enhanced if you show the number of coins earned so far today.

It has a wide variety of icons too.... which in my opinion makes it really aesthetic. You can also log in how much money for each habit, so that after you've finished the habit, it gives you the amount of money, which is really nice. So, if you're looking for an app like this, I recommend you to download it. Keep up with the good work.

As far as we know, Google Calendar cannot insert notifications. Calendars of other systems can be inserted normally. Google Calendar did not provide the interface for inserting notifications to developers.
In the future, we will realize the notification through other ways."
