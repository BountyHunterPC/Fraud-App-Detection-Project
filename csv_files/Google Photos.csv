I really wish you remove the ((+ new album)) option from library.. or place it at the bottom of the library as it really hinders the visually immersive experience. There is no need for that option in library at all as clicking it doesn't let you add photos from folders. You have to manually go inside folders to add pics into it, which I don't mind as the app is smooth and pleasent and it is easy to find photos & move them around.

It archived all of my photos, and although I can still access them they are no longer separated into the albums I had created. To make matters worse, it took the photos out of the albums in other storage apps I was using. On top of that, it claimed to be free but when it started backing up my data it quickly ran out of free storage space and threatened to stop my Gmail until I purchased a monthly additional storage amount.","107 people found this review helpful","","","",""

It sorts itself to last modified. I end up spending a lot of time looking through the albums to find what I need. Please put an option for us to sorr albums alphabetically and pin important albums for easy navigation. In the mean time, I have to use 3rd party photos app.","194 people found this review helpful","","Google LLC","November 7, 2022","Hi Marc. We value your feedback.

Automatically sorts them by date with no way to change it. Sorts albums into a single flat hierarchy instead of letting you group them into folders so you'll have to scroll though hundreds of albums to find what you're looking for. Trys to use AI to sort your photos but the AI sucks. Clearly made by a team that just wanted to deploy something and move onto the next project.","85 people found this review helpful","","Google LLC","November 2, 2022","Hi Dylan.

Except for one very minor detail. I believe it would be so much better if there was a simple ""on/off"" toggle switch that could easily stop photos from being added to both Google Photos & the default or built in photo gallery. Simply because I dislike having to delete every miss-taken photo or temporary screenshot from both platforms platforms. This is tedious and could potentially be confusing.","104 people found this review helpful","","","",""
