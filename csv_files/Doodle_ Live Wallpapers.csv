No crashes witnessed so far. I did not witness any jerks in the animations. Amazed this isn't a paid app. The only issue? Low variety of wallpapers. I know this is centred around Pixel phones and Live Wallpapers take their own sweet time to make but, you will, at some point, have to foray into styles different from that of Pixel to keep the app from getting stale. How do you plan to address that?","6 people found this review helpful","","","",""

These issues have now been fixed, as the developer is very dedicated and responsive. This app provides beautiful live wallpapers with ultra smooth animations that I cannot live without at this point. The Google Pixel experience is unparalleled and I love the imported cues and hints into Samsung's One UI. Recommended for everyone to try!","31 people found this review helpful","Show review history","Patrick Zedler","September 6, 2022","Thank you so much for your help and the updated review!

Interface/settings are awesome and there's so much potential in this. I absolutely love it for what it is. I'd love to see more variants of wallpapers but hey.... Not complaining! This app just straight up rocks!","11 people found this review helpful","","","",""

Criminally underrated phone just because it had a slightly thicker ""forehead"". Anyway, this app brings the aesthetic of my Pixel 4 to my new phone. Great little bit of nostalgia, love the randomizer function. I'd appreciate a preview function, otherwise very good.","5 people found this review helpful","Show review history","","",""

I absolutely love these wallpapers on my Pixel 6a. It somehow completely transforms the feel of the phone. But I do have a request - please avoid putting colorful dots on the bottom of the wallpaper, it gives the look that there is a notification from that app when seen from corner of the eye.","","Show review history","Patrick Zedler","October 31, 2022","Thank you so much! As they are all official or unofficial wallpapers from Google devices (this is what the app is about) I don't have the intention to modify the shape arrangements, it's intended that they look the same as the originals because people want exactly the original wallpapers in an improved wayüòÖ"

But, there is some weak point to improve like wallpaper is so bright and I can't see the text well on home screen. And we need the wallpaper preview feature when we choose the favorite wallpaper. And difficult to change.","","","Patrick Zedler","November 4, 2022","Thanks! The main reason why this app exists is auto dark mode and optional dark text, so the wallpaper should never be too bright. If the text doesn't change to dark for you, you should try another launcher, it's not my fault then. What favourite wallpaper feature do you mean and why should it be difficult to change the wallpaper?"

But in the next version of Doodle you can select a shorter interval than daily, so the screen off random mode is not really necessary anymore. Thank you! :)"

I have set mine to Screen Off and take great pleasure turning my screen off and on to see the change. There's room for growth; more designs for sure. The ability to make my own dynamic wallpapers would be nice down the line. Nice as is. Tk!","4 people found this review helpful","","Patrick Zedler","September 4, 2022","Thanks for your review! Please understand that every design in this app isn't just an image, it's a result of many hours of complex work including shape extraction, vector conversion and optimization for parallax effect. I will work on the next design as soon as I have enough time. In the meantime, please enjoy the existing ones."

But with bright wallpapers, the alert slider's text doesn't darken and so it stays white and you can't see anything. Can I change something in the settings? Because using bright wallpapers not from the app darkens the alert slider. (Using OnePlus on Oxygen 11).","","","Patrick Zedler","September 9, 2022","Thanks! In the appearance section under extracted colors you have to choose a bright primary color so that the system knows that the wallpaper is mainly bright. If that doesn't work, I sadly have no clue why, the launcher should calculate the contrast with the primary color."
