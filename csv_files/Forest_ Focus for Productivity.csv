The concept of gamification of time management means it provides a fun quotient to the tasks that I'm tracking. I could also view my progress in the form of a forest that is really intuitive. One thing I'd have liked to see was custom tags on the free version. That would have made tracking progress even simpler and intuitive. Also sometimes it doesn't notify when a task is completed which can be frustrating.","24 people found this review helpful","","",""

I really like using it and am therefore a pro member. However, one major concern I have is the absence of Pause button. At times there are many occasions that I had to run for work in the middle of the schedule, hence unable to track my work effectively. Also, option for timer or stopwatch will be beneficial. Kindly incorporate the feature in the next update. As of now I have shifted temporarily to Engross. Hope to get back soon.","210 people found this review helpful","","",""

There's a ""give up"" button but I can still just press home button, use other apps and the plant still grows. I'm a big procasinator lol. And my phone's ""focus mode"" is better, doesn't let me use my phone for the set time, has exceptions for 4 apps and emergency calls. This app doesn't fullfill my needs and most of the features are behind a paywall.","167 people found this review helpful","","",""

Honestly it deserves five stars but the only tiny thing that I dislike is that in the free version, we only have a few species available to purchase with coins earned. While the pro version has so many beautiful trees that cannot be accessed by me yet. So it would be really appreciated if some really pretty species could be unlocked with coins :) It's just my request though, and other than that, it's the best!","20 people found this review helpful","","",""

Really impressed by the design and flows. But what's even better than it makes you do work. The deep mode is well crafted. Kudos to the minds behind this app. My only suggest would be the back button used once the tree is planted. That button looks more like an email button to reply. Changing that would surely not make a big difference but it'll be more pleasing to view things in unison.","153 people found this review helpful","","",""

This is a simple app, built clean, and it is clear that the creators have put effort into it. Gain coins by planting trees and focusing. The deep focus mode is very useful, and the system of tree planting and tree withering is fantastic.

But I recently found out that the app has access to considerable personal information.

If I don't turn on the deep focus mode then the app loses half it's meaning.

As Forest has to continuously detect the usage of other apps to ensure the proper functioning, planting trees requires certain amount of battery.

Just discovered that it doesn't accurately track time at all. On the forest tab it tells you how long you focused on a particular day. But if you actually count each tree the real time focused is higher! This makes the app absolutely useless for actually tracking time.","1 person found this review helpful","Seekrtech","October 31, 2022","Hello, sorry to hear about this, but this does not sound usual at all!

This has the bonus of being able to work to unlock some plants, but after I have unlocked those I do not know if I will continue using this app. Hope they come up with new plants! This app is one of my favourites because I can categorize my time in different tags as well as leave the app running on the background if needed.","2 people found this review helpful","","",""

No shrinking circle or shrinking bar, you're either looking at the size of the tree or reading the timer. Hopefully one day they add something easier to see without looking directly at the phone.","2 people found this review helpful","","",""

The monetization is a bit annoying, but I'm planning to upgrade to remove those elements (unless this app has a subscription model, in which case I'll suffer through the ads etc.)","7 people found this review helpful","","",""

Just make sure to open the deep focus option. What I love here is that it makes me not touch any app especially that I have problem in my focusing system. It's just that it has a premium option. I can't afford that so I'll settle for less muna","6 people found this review helpful","","",""
