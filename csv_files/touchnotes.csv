Zoom, edit, cut&paste, styles, etcetera. I like it. One gripe: palm detection (on a tablet) isn't too good, leading to random zoom, move, notes opening, and what not. Oh yeah, another gripe: drawing small things in max zoom is annoying; the pen changes to an eraser within a fraction of a second, making it impossible to work carefully. Is there a forum? I have a request: two- or three-finger tap gesture for undo (or some other gesture)","8 people found this review helpful"

I have only one reason why I didn't buy the premium (because if this problem didn't exist, it is a ★★★★★ app), the images sometimes dissapear, also the text and sometimes complete pages. The design isn't the best, but, again, is the most complete.","1 person found this review helpful"

For me most difficult part is changing the color it should be much more straightforward. Because usually when we write we change color and delete. But i can only access 3 colors quickly for the other ones i need to scroll which is very inconvenient. The other improvement should be better search functionality not just file names and type writing recognition.","4 people found this review helpful"

It's very easy to import pdfs, mark them up, select from numerous templates, and resized graph, lined, and dot paper per the desired size. There are a few cons. Google drive is not available to backup automatically, there is no clicking on a button on the stylus to erase, and shapes are awkward to use. Otherwise it's great for a university student","5 people found this review helpful"

MAJOR brownie points for being able to upload my own fonts I've purchased! Every note taking app I've tried doesn't have that option and it's disappointing. I LOVE this app so far. You can doodle, write, add images, voice, links, you name it. You can even save your drawings as stickers. You have the ability to add your digital notebooks and planner PDF files as well. When you're done, you can export them. Must download this app!","22 people found this review helpful"

This app seriously helped me fire up my productivity. For a free app, IT has A LOT of features for each elements of an e-notebook, yet it is straightforward and simply neat. If you are the type of person who just wants a simple, highly-functional, and easy-to-use notebook, go for this app. I never rate apps but I made an exception to this one. Kudos to the makers of this app. You're literally helping me to achieve an engineering degree.",""

I would use it constantly; but I never get an option to actual purchase any tools, only the notification that [ whatever item ] is a VIP service, but I cannot seem to find how to purchase it. So based on frustration I use different apps, instead of this one. I wish there was a one time purchase Pro version. I hate the hassle of pieces parts purchases. Even more- subscriptions.","9 people found this review helpful"

It has the best versatility with stickers, color options and ui. I took off a star because it is lacking in cloud sync functions. It does not suppose Google drive or one drive. The Dropbox option is offered but never syncs. It would be good if you plan to use it exclusively on one device.","15 people found this review helpful"

The latest update is horrible!! I lost all my notes and I cannot retrieve back. I tried to import notes from my local files, it shows ""cannot open file"" when it literally appeared on my app home screen... With the upgrade, I cannot import multiple PDFs when it could last time.

It has a bunch of features that help make studying a lot easier. Split pdf,customisable toolbars,backups and page customization. In my opinion, the one-time purchase for premium ($ 10) is really worth it. You won't be disappointed. High-school and college students will really appreciate this. Used this for awhile now and i still love it. Perfect for studying, though not much for graphic design.","19 people found this review helpful"

If sticker function at least could come back. It wasn't necessarily like there were preloaded stickers, it was just stuff you could select and save which was super cool.

It could show bookmark button + 2 characters for example. Or maybe no bookmark button but the first 5-6 characters of the page's name.
