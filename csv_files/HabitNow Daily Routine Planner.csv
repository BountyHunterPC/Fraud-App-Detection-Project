By default the theme is dark but that doesn't matter. The features and the available options are perfect. You could have asked for a sign up so that multiple device sync wouldn't be a problem. That's the only thing i could find as an issue. Do let me know if there's a solution other than backup.. after two days of use, notification is not proper be it just a notification or alarm, it is not working. No point in creating habits to track.","17 people found this review helpful","HabitNow","November 2, 2022","Hi Augustin: Your One Plus is blocking the reminders.

I've been using a journal before, but with this app, it is more motivating when you see graphs and plots of your improvement. This has no ads and has simplest interface. I'm a premium user and it's worth every penny I gave. I would encourage everyone to go for it without hesitation. This app brought more productivity and consistency to me may it be, to keep up with a good habit or to quit a bad habit.

However is there any option or feature that I can put a link (of any local file or a from internet) that can be open by touching it. Currently I couldn't find anything like this.

Very light-weight, easy to use. Best statistics, habit score features. Most task manager/habit tracker apps have way too many features but don't even fulfill the basic requirements. Moreover, they are full of ads/disabled features and require a subscription, which is totally worthless. This app can be used completely for free. But once you start using, you would be more than willing to do the one time purchase, which itself is nominal.","47 people found this review helpful","HabitNow","December 19, 2020","Thank you very much for your review Kashif!

For the latter, you need to toggle twice, but the entry disappears on the first toggle. Some solutions might be introducing a timer before the entry disappears, so I can have time to mark a lapse, or having a different interaction to mark those - e.g. double-taps.","9 people found this review helpful","","",""

It would be nice if you could reorder the items in the checklist, as it seems the only way to change the order is to delete everything & start over. It would also be nice to be able to duplicate (copy/past) tasks as opposed to starting from scratch if you have similarly worded tasks.","26 people found this review helpful","","",""
