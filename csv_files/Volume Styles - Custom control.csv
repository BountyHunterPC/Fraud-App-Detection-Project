There are some bugs though.. 1. On Snapchat, it shows the default volume slider. 2. Volume styles appear even on the always on display (Samsung). 3. While taking screenshots, the volume panel is visible. 4. Not a bug, but while using wireless earbuds, Bluetooth icon would be better while increasing or decreasing the volume. Please look into these issues!","241 people found this review helpful"

But there is one issue, I kept my phone to restart every morning so that it performs good for the rest of the day, after the restart, the app doesn't work. When I press the volume keys, the normal in build phone's volume UI comes in play, not the app's one. So is it because of my phone's restart or anything else with the app?","186 people found this review helpful"

But a few things needed to be fixed. 1. While cancelling the sound (the crossed bell icon), it directly goes to DND mode. 2. While taking screenshot volume bar is appearing. 3. For taking pictures volume button does not work. I would be appreciated if you look after the flaws 😊.","197 people found this review helpful"

The only problem I happened to encounter is, when i try to increase or decrease the volume by touching the volume rocker and sliding it up or down, the actual volume remains the same, but the volume panel shows that the volume has been increased/decreased. The volume can only be changed by using the volume buttons. I have downloaded this app on realme 6.","30 people found this review helpful"

App is amazing with so many different styles. It can change the personality of your app. issue I've found with the app is the position of it in Landscape Mode. The app let you adjust the position of sliders but it often cut out in the landscape mode. Because the app doesn't let you adjust position for different orientation. In order to get the full volume bar for landscape, need to raise its position. Which will affect your exp in portrait mod","118 people found this review helpful"

Does what it claims to do. Works beautifully. Number of skins and customizations provided in Volume Styles for free is much more than those provided by other such apps even after you pay for them. Best volume styler app out there!! EDIT : After updating my phone to Android 11, on landscape mode, the volume slider is only half visible. This wasn't the case when my device was running on Android 10. I request the developer to kindly fix this soon.","15 people found this review helpful"

This app do the work as it described. I'm happy with the application however there is a only one problem sometimes the volume stuck half like 50% only while playing songs and watching YouTube through earphones. I thought it might be a glitch however it usually happens. I have to switch to the stock volume bars in order to increase the volume.","9 people found this review helpful"

Bit there are bugs aswell which needs to be fixed a) The positioning of the volume panel is erratic for different community styles. The change of position via swipe to open does not get applied even if the provision to apply exists. Suppose I want to keep in the lower bottom corner does not work. b) Shortcuts that appear in the volume slider except for the settings dont work. They just vibrate when the option to vibrate is enabled. c) The sort of vol typ is not working .","18 people found this review helpful"

I'd rate it 5 stars otherwise, since I definitely triple checked that I have battery optimization disabled. Sometimes the app will go a week without crashing, other times once a day. Another annoying thing is having to uncheck and recheck the permissions settings after the app crashes, since it seems to think I turned it off.","49 people found this review helpful"

However, sometimes it gets stuck at the top of the screen, or the accessibility service might stop working, which means you have to go to Accessibility settings and turn it off and on again. It's still worth it, though, and it's well polished, with lots of features.","4 people found this review helpful"
