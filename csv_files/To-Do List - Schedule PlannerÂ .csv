The app's interface is fairly good too, but the dark theme is too light to be called ""dark"". I appreciate that it has a statistics feature and that it separates ""today"" and ""future"" tasks in the same page unlike other popular apps. It is certainly super useful... There is swipe to mark complete, but there is no animation; it feels weird to use. The app needs some simple animation(s) to make it feel good.","185 people found this review helpful","Dairy App & Notes & Audio Editor & Voice Recorder","July 11, 2022","Hi, thanks for your feedback.

And it really helps us to manage all our tasks efficiently. We can categorize our tasks and complete it accordingly. The app also allows us to have it on our home screen so we don't open it again and again. There are also no unnecessary ads shown. But yes, there is one irritating part that the pop up for premium membership always comes up whenever I open the app. Please fix this problem. Otherwise, it is a very comfortable app. 5 stars from my side!ðŸ‘Œ","366 people found this review helpful","","","",""

I can get reminders the day before. All that being said, there are a few things holding me back from a 5 star and getting a premium account.

I can keep track of my tasks because of the task tracker, it reminds you five minutes before the time that you set for the task, and it has different tas categories which you can add more if the task you are looking for is not in the options.

If I'm adding the plus on my ""personal"", that means it goes to my personal. They put it in some other place and you have to search for it. The fact that you need an expensive subscription to add a picture is ridiculous. The biggest thing were the widgets. You can only add one 4x3 because you can't have one ""personal"" and one ""wishlist"" of the same size. Not worth even $5.

I tried testing it as I had just downloaded this for school purposes but when I set the time, the reminder/alarm didn't work. Please tell me what's wrong.","","Dairy App & Notes & Audio Editor & Voice Recorder","October 9, 2022","Hello, 1.

This is definitely it!! I love using this app to see if I completed task, such as school work, chores, etc.","","","","",""

However, it would be better if aside from ""today"" and "" future"", there would also be a ""someday"" tab in the dashboard where you can put tasks that you would want to deal with later.","17 people found this review helpful","Dairy App & Notes & Audio Editor & Voice Recorder","September 13, 2022","Hi, thanks for your feedback.
