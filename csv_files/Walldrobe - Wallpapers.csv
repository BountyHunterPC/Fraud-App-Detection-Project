So much so that I bought the premium for the same but lately it's been causing problems quite often resulting in a very tainted user experience. The one big one I've been having for a while now is that for the auto wallpaper, the crop more often than not is wrong It's almost always too zoomed into one specific area of the image. I've tried all the settings inside the app nothing seems to work","28 people found this review helpful","","","",""

One issue with the app - after sometime it automatically loses purchased history from the app. Have to go back to settings and restore the purchase. And another that sometimes some wallpapers in automatic update feature get stretched and set on the homescreen. If these issues are fixed i will give 5 stars to app.","19 people found this review helpful","Noyal Jose","June 19, 2020","Thank you for the feedback.

But you people have literally destroyed the beauty of this app with this new update. Not happy at all now, I want to roll back to older version, is it possible? The fact that there are only few wallpapers updated in the 'explore' section on daily basis, besides its impossible to go through every item in 'collections', The scrolling is never ending.. It was way more easy earlier.","18 people found this review helpful","Noyal Jose","July 14, 2020","What are you missing in the new update","Show review history"

But that is not working. I tuned off battery optimizations still not use. I would suggest putting a notification to keep it memory so it's not killed by OS. Update 1: As you said I looked in stand by apps and it's Exempted there. So It must not be the problem. Update 2: Wrote a small automate flow to open and close app working now but I would have been able to do auto wallpaper change in this way without premium.","3 people found this review helpful","Noyal Jose","May 25, 2019","Ok in your case do this. 1.

In other apps I've seen, you can do so by for example clicking with 3 fingers. The notification is not enough, since I'd have to keep it always there. I just saw the quick setting tile. Not as good as a fingers gesture, but it's something. 5 stars. Update: I don't understand why this app forces you to disable the battery optimization for it. Update 2: It's eating my battery.
