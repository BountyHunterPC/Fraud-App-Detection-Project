It is now showing two seprate App icons. If I delete one of them, the other also gets deleted automatically. And I have already tried deleting and reinstalling the App from the Google Play Store - doesn't help.","4 people found this review helpful","Vodafone Idea Ltd.","October 29, 2022","Hi!

Your app's front-end looks great but backend is worst. We have Google for our entertainment needs so you should just focus on what you do best, as a telecom operator.","4 people found this review helpful","Vodafone Idea Ltd.","November 8, 2022","Hi!

Would like to give a suggestion to add a small feature i.e. when you recharge for others can you add a small note below the number which was recharged, that the number of pending days for next recharge. This will help us to recharge that number when you have elderly people at your home, who can't remember. Would appreciate if this feature can be added. Thanks!!!","8 people found this review helpful","Vodafone Idea Ltd.","November 5, 2022","Hi! We are delighted to know that you are having an amazing experience with us - Team Vi",""

Now i have 10 mb/sec while downloading something.They have improved a lot in a year.This app offers 1gb free data till midnight twice a month .They have done a lote than possibly other networks and i yet dont know why you all sayin like this.

Also I Switched On/Off my device several times. Poorest of the poor experience. Of all the places at VARANASI I am getting message ""Emergency calls only"" since 3 days consecutively. This situation is very pathetic. Not at all called for a situation like this. It is a disgrace on the part of Vi. I feel ASHAMED when any body isn't able to contact me. Regarding Vi App : It is very difficult to find Feedback/Complaints buttons.","18 people found this review helpful","Vodafone Idea Ltd.","October 8, 2022","Hi!

I have been using VI from many years but I think it's time to change the operator. Feeling extremely nurvous. The VI Android app is also not working properly as I was about to complain about service.","21 people found this review helpful","Vodafone Idea Ltd.","September 25, 2022","Hi!

It has a download speed of 40kbps,it can't even play a hd or full hd video without buffering at every 10 seconds and many times the network doesn't even work. I would have given it 0 rating if the option was available","6 people found this review helpful","Vodafone Idea Ltd.","October 26, 2022","""Hi! We regret the inconvenience caused.
