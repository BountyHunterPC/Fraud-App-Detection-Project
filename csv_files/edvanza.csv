I tried multiple times to sign up but never received a confirmation email in order to sign in. I tried with 3 different email address. There is no option to resend the confirmation code so you get stuck in a loop of not being able to sign in without the confirmation but not having it and not being able to do anything about that. I've reached out for support on two separate occasions but never received any. Disappointing.","","November 17, 2022","Hi Jen,
