A very functional application that I am satisfied with. I do have a couple of suggestions and complaints. I am using this application on my Chromebook and it does not let me group my documents in a folder. In fact, there is no option to create a folder! I would also like to request a feature that allows us to open multiple documents simultaneously on different tabs. thanks","2,758 people found this review helpful"

Presents too many premium features around the UI (home, menu, etc) for the free user. Even share feature has the whole body content dedicated to signing-in/creating Adobe's account while the standard share feature is tucked at the bottom of the screen as clipper icon. Not interested in getting into their ecosystem.","2,492 people found this review helpful"

The interface makes you fight it for every little edit and change, the bullet point options are black when in dark mode so you can't see them, and the reason why I am deleting it is because it forces you to stay zoomed in on the document when editing. That's right, you cannot zoom out and view a full page at once, you can only zoom out far enough to see the entire width of the page, and no more. Oh, and you can't create a blank PDF. The ""create"" option is for converting","85 people found this review helpful"

I edited some resumes and got everything I could edited, given the limited features of the program, and saved them as they appeared fine in the original viewing. As I started to send them to where they needed to be, I noticed the thumbnail looked different. When I opened the documents I found that all of the text I had edited was a blank space!! Hours of work went in to the edits for those resumes just to find out they were ruined because of your program! Worst $10 ever spent!!","1,580 people found this review helpful"

It's not even possible to add bullet points from what I can see. The fact that they ask for a subscription for this barely functional app that is only better than Notepad because the text is in boxes. That's it, it's not better formatted, it's literally just in a box. If I could give negative starts for wasting my time I would.","1,410 people found this review helpful"

The limited functionality has caused me hours of work. Highlight coloring is limited to 9. There is no manual saving apart from saving a copy, and the document is supposed to save automatically, but it does not. I have lost many hours of work, as on multiple occasions saving it as a copy would result in saving a previous version rather than the one I am working on. My annotations have disappeared in front of me. Add a manual 'save as' function.","200 people found this review helpful"

When you enter your card number, that number should not be checked until AFTER the trial period is up. Fix this its broken. Also, app saves everything you put into the subscription areas. It doesnt get rid of them, even if you clear data/cache. Dangerous. DO NOT USE.","376 people found this review helpful"
