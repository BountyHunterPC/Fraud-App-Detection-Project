It is my todo list, but it looks cute and i earn a steady amount of rewards. I do feel more themes and purchasable items are needed, but i am sure they will come. Only reason for 4star is due to scheduling. It'd be nice to have the option to add a task as ""every 4 days"" or ""every other day"", etc. I have tasks only due every so many days, not on a specific day of the week.","5 people found this review helpful","Fourdesire","September 23, 2022","Hi Adventurer, thanks for sharing!

This is my second time downloading it after uninstalling it for a while, and it has gotten better! I really like how productive it makes me feel, but there are still quite some bugs in it. I wish there was a feature where tasks organized themselves based on category because it is so annoying/difficult for me to hold-down a task and move it to a certain spot. Also, i wish there was a graphics setting because my phone heats up within just 5-10min of opening the app.","42 people found this review helpful","Fourdesire","September 23, 2022","Hi Adventurer, thanks for sharing!

It needs a lot of development like the vibrantion or other small details. But it's concept is useful, it helps me to compare my progress, it tells me how many task I've cancel more than previous plans and it shows me which categories I tend to declain more. The biggest inconvenient that I have is its schedule, because it's confusing, so I think it would be better to see a calendar by months, like most agendas show.","17 people found this review helpful","Fourdesire","September 23, 2022","Hi Adventurer, thanks for sharing!

There are ads if you don't pay, but its fine since they need to make money somehow. Being able to access the calendar easily would be nice, at least when I want to get a big picture view it doesn't seem readily available to get a calendar view of things. More settings might be nice- like leaving more options always on (I'd like to reduce number of taps when I regularly want access to reminder, notes, etc).","20 people found this review helpful","Fourdesire","September 23, 2022","Hi Adventurer, thanks for sharing!

I don't always get task reminders. Once Review plan is done and create a new journey, all my occurrence tasks are gone. I'm so disappointed! I cannot start over again.

There is the option to set tasks for 'someday' rather than a specific day, which is great, what's not great is that those tasks can't really be viewed after that. There's no masterlist of tasks and the schedule only displays tasks set for a specific day.
