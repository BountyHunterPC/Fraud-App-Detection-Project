Plus, this app has so many bright wallpapers that I really don't like at all. Thank youüòä","17,928 people found this review helpful",""

I've read that many people couldn't apply the wallpaper, but I just downloaded and applied it without any hiccups. Just won't hit 5 stars because they really have a very small amount of options and didn't even bother adding an option to either get more from your gallery or downloading from the internet. Still, that can be achieved straight from WhatsApp itself, so not really much of a problem.","18,688 people found this review helpful",""

I'd recommend using the custom wallpaper feature instead as this is just a no go. The app is never gonna update it's never been and well, if you download it, you just waste space.

No option to add more. None that really offer more than a windows XP background. Thoroughly underwhelming. And looking through the comments and 5* ratings I now belive they have somehow cheated the stats. This app is as close to useless as they come and its being praised like its a bank of 100s of images, decent images, that are updated. What use is a comment and rating system if this is the result? I give up.","2,255 people found this review helpful","Show review history"
