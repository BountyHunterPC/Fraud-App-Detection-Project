Not only can I schedule the smallest events and tasks possible, but I can track them too and I bet I can do much more which I'm yet to learn, because this app is filled with functions. Not only that, it's highly customisable and I've never seen an app like this before. I'm just really impressed by it! I love that there is absolutely no ads either, but I'm still going to buy the pro version to support the developers :)","68 people found this review helpful","Oleksandr Albul","July 10, 2022","Thank you very much Olivia!

The calendar view is especially convenient! But it will be even better if we were able to add deadlines for each task as well and have it show up on the calendar. Otherwise I'm having to use both MS tasks for deadlines and this app for keeping track of my tasks. Please include this! It will be incredibly helpful.","2 people found this review helpful","","",""

Best part is about statistics, you get very clear picture through statistics. You might find the app overwhelming at beginning, but thanks to tutorials, things become easy! Keep it up guys..this app is helping alot. Tip- You can add more views to statistics like line graphs, bar charts along with the pie chart that u currently have to get better idea of how u have spent days in a day, month or year.","48 people found this review helpful","Oleksandr Albul","June 19, 2022","Thank you Aditi!

The App hits a sweet spot between the freedom of a paper journal/diary and the neatness of automation/electronic medium. The layout & structure should be intuitive for most. Am sure some minor tweaks over time will help fine tune it. A short learning curve allowed me to hit the ground running. The YouTube video tutorials were a breeze. Am glad to have found something which doesn't force me to choose Event or Task in the unrealistic bipolar world of 'Calendars'. 👍🏻","72 people found this review helpful","Oleksandr Albul","October 15, 2019","Thank you very much for your warm words!

I started using it when the new school year began and I don't know where I would have been without it. It's very customisable, almost like a sandbox but for planning. Setting up different categories helped me keep a list of things to be done in a week and then further break it down into manageable daily tasks with other categories. Honestly my productivity has shot up more than 100% because I'm able to effectively plan my day keeping time in mind.
