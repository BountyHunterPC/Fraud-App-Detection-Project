I can't even figure out how to add items to a list for the grocery store. Way way too much. These guys have forgotten a core principle of design. Beauty is simply and function. And above all it has to work and be easy to use. I'll be deleting this monstrosity and sideloading the legacy version.","4 people found this review helpful",""

Nice U.I. too and reasonably priced without subscription! It would be nice the lists in "" today "" mode to be foldable and to have the ability to make simple plain notes ( not notes in tasks that you already can ). BIG minus the lack of dark mode!","1 person found this review helpful",""

Definitely check out the tutorial vids. There aren't many button descriptions which is great once you know how it works but hides lots of features if you don't take the time to go through the tutorials. The only serious downside that could convince me to switch to another app is the lack of an pc based interface. Everything needs to be done in the app which can be cumbersome and inefficient at times.","14 people found this review helpful",""

I make different categories - work, home, school - then pop in tasks or lists. Easy to add things on the go. Love the reminder and due date features. The reminders pop up on my notifications. So, you can set them to come up first thing or at the time you need to do them. So it can work as a task list or even an appointment reminder.. Love that it lives on my phone - no connection needed. Great app!","15 people found this review helpful",""

Subtasks and checklists are fantastic for tracking my habits and bigger projects. The UI takes a small bit of getting used to with a lot of swiping involved but I like it now and I like the appearance more than any other app. Integration with Google Calendar would be amazing, but I realise that that's probably trickier than it sounds. Still, great app and I'm delighted I found it!","16 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

I cannot drag tasks of a project to change order, location reminder gives API errors, dark mode, dark mode, dark mode! And I would really expect a Web version for quick entering and project management. Trying to manage it all from a phone or tablet is really limiting. Focus mode is very cool, projects, tasks and checklists are really done well, it just needs some polishing.","4 people found this review helpful",""

Loads of unintuitive little pictogram buttons with no explanation what they do Some you click on and nothing seems to happen (e.g. the little sun?). Some you click on and baffling things happen ( what does ""smart list created"" mean? No apparent state change and no explanation provided beyond those words). You expect three dots to lead to a menu (like in every other app)? Nope! Here it means ""toggle batch edit"" and swipe right is the menu.","7 people found this review helpful",""

It had everything I wanted including: - No subscriptions. Once off purchase only. - CalDAV support for syncing to my own server - Effective UI that is the right level of complexity for a mobile device, but not overly simple like some other apps. - Equivalent iOS apps for cross-device functionality The app is very fast, written as a native app and the dev fixed a small issue I noticed within a day. I would recommend to anyone looking for a toro manager.","11 people found this review helpful",""

Does not force you into any one way of sorting or viewing your stuff. Impressive regarding how much it lets you do without overwhelming you in terms of the UI. Features like markdown support, CSV export, and syncing to Dropbox and other cloud services put this in the professional League. This is a mature product that nonetheless remains true to a coherent design vision, rather than being a mishmash of conflicting features. Well done.","8 people found this review helpful",""

Cannot make an arbitrary hierarchy of checklists within a checklist. This is how life actually is. No graphical tree to quickly find subtasks of things needing to be done.

I love it. About four years ago I found myself extremely busy at work and at home and began applying GTD to get through it all. I tried Tick Tick (free) but didn't want to pay for a subscription to unlock features I needed, which rules out several other apps. Omnifocus is Mac-only. I doubt I'll ever switch away from 2do. One-time purchase, free Dropbox sync, lots of versatile features. Perfect for me.","13 people found this review helpful",""

Until now! 2Do is the holy grail of all task managers, whether you just want a simple checklist or fully fledged projects. 2Do is so flexible and customisable that it has genuinely helped me manage my life and business. A special mention to the developers must be made, I had a few queries and all I can say is that the level of support and the speed of their response was second to none. They care passionately about 2Do and their customers user experience. The biggest deciding factor for me is that 2Do is a one-off purchase and not subscription based which again the developers have also voiced their disapproval of subscriptions. This again shows that the developers care more about the quality and integrity of the product and customer experience rather than trying to make a quick buck. I can't recommend 2Do highly enough, buy it now, you won't regret it!","12 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

This has now ended with email support for capturing tasks via email, now an extra charge. What's worse is that this is not a mechanism to email tasks to 2do, but you have to give Beehive Innovations the keys to all your email. I'm not handing you access to all my email and it certainly isn't necessary for getting emails into 2do. Perhaps now is time for a change of app.  Response to Dev: I have not said it's a subscription, but that the one-off payment is now two one-off payments. Your app may not send you anything, but because my credentials are entered into the app, it gives you access to everything if you chose to access it. The more apps that have my email credentials the less secure my email becomes.
