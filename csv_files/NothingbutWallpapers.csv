Unfortunately, humans are not review bots, and as such, most do not like this app. Bugs are quite common and annoying, crashes still happen after so many (probably useless) updates, and the wallpapers are clearly not 4k. The categories are ok, but it's almost impossible to find a wallpaper you really like. When you do find one, expect to be disappointed by blurriness anyway.","129 people found this review helpful","AsdlorDesigns","September 8, 2022","Hey Kid ,
Providing 1* Feedback won't fix your issue(if you want the issue to be fixed) ! 
ANDROID is a much larger Ecosystem than other OS.
So Giving Logs , regarding crash/bugs  are much needed according to a developer . This is hell of a FREE WALLPAPER APP, with NO ADS & Minimal UI. Comes with handfull of handmade walls.
Uninstall & Peace."

Unfortunately though, when I launch the app it says ""license valid"" on a toast type message within the app and then all of what I assume to be wallpapers stay grey with a bar in the middle. The thumbnails wont load. I've tried waiting for a minute, but it's not my wifi, or data that's causing the issue. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Nothing's worked yet though. Willing to give a chance still! Has promise.","26 people found this review helpful","","",""
