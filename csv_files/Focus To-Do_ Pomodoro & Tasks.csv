Especially the flip mode, once the timer is set you are supposed to flip your phone or the pomodora will turn off. This really helps with tackling distractions. Overall really great app. It's only my second day but I am already very impressed.","37 people found this review helpful",""

Helps me focus on a single task, one pomodoro at a time. I'll be using this app regularly. Edit: Alright, in my previous edit I was unfairly harsh and reduced rating to 2 because I didn't know I was using a free trial of premium. But I really love the app now, even with the limited free version. It has a great design, and the integration of pomodoro with to-do is just beautifully perfect. Will definitely upgrade to premium someday.","35 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

This app has everything required. Maintaining logs and statistics as well. But one big problem, is that it keeps crashing. After my study session I come to see that the timer stopped in the middle and no record is mentioned of anything. That's annoying and because of this I'm not able to maintain my stats to analyze my day. Please fix it.","42 people found this review helpful",""

I have been trying out different apps on the subject. Luckily, I stumbled upon this app. The features available are apt for anyone seeking to minimize digital distraction and thus achieve one's optimal potential. Enjoying every bit of the features available. Only one issue is that, the premium subscription is bit over priced for students. But overall, it will be worth an investment.

I use it for studying purposes. it needs to have a few minor adjustments tho. needs a little tweaking. example: when i have set a task, and I do my 25 mins + 5 mins brk, then that task should be shown as completed automatically instead of me having to manually click on it. well inshort, the team have made a very good and reliable app. thanks","7 people found this review helpful",""

It is very simple to operate. And my favourite feature is that the timer works only when your phone is turned over and that us very helpful and phone is a prime source of distraction. But if you flip it the the timer restrarts. And during the break the timer works while using the phone. You can write in here and keep things as reminder efficiently. You can also listen to music which helps you focus. I would be really happy if we could input our own songs.","152 people found this review helpful",""

I use the windows version on my computer and recently installed the android version. Now for the last 2 weeks, my progress is not getting saved accurately on my windows version. It is extremely disheartening when you have put in loads of Pomodoros in a day, and none of it is saved the next day including thr completed task. I want to give you 5 stars. Please fix the issue.","25 people found this review helpful",""

No issues of ads even if I am not a premium member. You can even sign in and I think it would give further good options(I haven't done it yet). Perfect app for students. If u are gonna take the phone after setting time, it will start vibrating and that will just make us to keep the phone back. (Psychological moveüòÇ). Also you can block the apps to which you are kinda addicted and there is an option to set music too.I just loved this!","3 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

It has all the features like a plant that grows when you study, to do list, pomodoro timer and even more. The only reason why I put 4 stars is because I wanted to request the developers to enable the reminder feature for free because the premium is too overpriced and I cannot purchase it. The reminder feature which reminds you about tasks is essential for us students. Thanks üòä","181 people found this review helpful",""

I have a few missing items due to which it gets a star less: 1. There's no support for repeating tasks. I have to add the take everyday. 2. There's no variability of time slot per application.This needs to change evey time manually. 3. It's seems to be a Chinese app and I'm worried about data privacy","18 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Please provide an option to pause/stop the timer directly from notification panel rather than going in the app and then pausing/stopping it. It would save our time. 2.

I would like to use it for Time-boxing as well, you could add more features there for adding tasks and tracking 2.Like the Flip Timer it already has, I wish the dev can also had a Pomodoro timer display like how it looks in TimeTimer, like an analogue clock where the remaining time is shown in red.","3 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

I am a medical student who wanted a To-do list, organizer, and pomodoro timer to serve as my one stop shop. Focus To-Do works great for that. It's efficient, easy to understand, and minimalist. There's no syncing with my email or background organizing I have to worry about. It just does what I tell it to. Very satisfied!","7 people found this review helpful",""
