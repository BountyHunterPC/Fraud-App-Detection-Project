What makes it my favorite is the way you can just type ""buy bread tomorrow"" and it automatically sets the reminder for tomorrow, rather than you having to manually set the date. The only issue I have is that when my Samsung phone goes into power saver mode, and then comes out of it, the Todoist widget doesn't load. I thought it would be fixed with updates, but it's never resolved. Hence one less star.","9 people found this review helpful","Doist Inc.","October 21, 2022","Hi Nathan! Thanks for your review!

There are two things i request the developers to look into. 1. There must be a proper notification. Better if we get some kind of alarm kind of notification. Right now, the notification feature is not that effective. 2. I have done integration with the Google Calendar. But if you put a task on a particular date and time, it is added in the calendar as an one hour task by default. Later, i go to the calendar to change it","32 people found this review helpful","Doist Inc.","June 16, 2022","Hello, You can set a custom event duration from Todoist on a task by task basis by typing something like [80m] into the task name.

It would be great if there was a PROPER inbuilt calendar where I can see all the past, present & future tasks both completed & incomplete, it would be truly great & would help me in organising & tracking stuff. The complete task sound effect is horrible, consider adding more options. And taking users to ""today"" tab every time is not a great idea, I would recommend ""inbox"" tab instead. It shows more things & not everyone adds a date to tasks","41 people found this review helpful","Doist Inc.","July 30, 2021","Thank you for the feedback!

The current completed tasks shows it each day and it can be messy. It would be lovely to see them categorized. For example, the label is ""gratitude"" it would be nice to see the achieved tasks there which indirectly tells me to be grateful for.","","","","",""

The one big deal breaker for me is that if you have a daily recurring task it becomes overdue at midnight. If you tap it complete after midnight, it completes it for the next day which ends up with you missing a day unless you remember to do it on your own or manually set the next recurrence to today.","39 people found this review helpful","Doist Inc.","September 26, 2022","Hi Brandon!

It's what makes me aware of everything of what's going on or what i don't. I have a suggestion though. Can ya'll add a days/hours/mins away due feature where you can keep in track of how much time a task has left until due? That'll be great!","5 people found this review helpful","Doist Inc.","September 26, 2022","Hi Gernil! Thanks for your review!

You can put it on Pro only. I really would like to be able to adjust what time a ""new day"" starts. Sometimes I'm up past midnight and complete some daily tasks after midnight, but it messes it all up because they don't show up for the next day because technically I've already completed them that day. I'd like the app to start a ""new day"" at, say, 3am instead of midnight. Can you add that please?","","Doist Inc.","October 13, 2022","Hello! Thanks for your review! We really appreciate it ü§ó

I have a recurring weekly task of ""review week"". Having this function at weekly and maybe even monthly would assist greatly in self reflection!","1 person found this review helpful","Doist Inc.","September 12, 2022","Thanks for your suggestion, Matt!
