Would love if more features are added like a pending or today's tasks widget on my phone screen without opening the app, also a place to write your notes or shopping lists would also be great.. (in unscheduled tasks we need to click the task and then it shows the list... Instead if it had a better interface that would make it better.)","44 people found this review helpful","","","",""

It seems like since the last update, 1/2 of my tasks aren't being counted as completed once I ""pop"" them as done. I'll have to make a couple fake tasks and pop them until one of them counts. I don't know why the app is doing this. I've restarted my phone, cleared the app's cache, and redownloaded the app, but nothing has changed. It's frustrating to have an app I love so much lose one of it's best parts!","15 people found this review helpful","","","",""

What I would like to see is an "" as soon as possible option"" and the sooner you do it the more points you get and perhaps also to be able to see the unscheduled tasks as water balls as well (perhaps you could swipe left to see those bit default view is the current day). Cause many things do not have a harsh deadline (or none) and I want to pop those too.","2 people found this review helpful","","","",""

I love the sense of adventure and upgrading the islands. I appreciate that I can make my own tags (though I kind of wish I had categories also) and the color scheme is so soothing. It's just a really beautiful and sweet app, like a nice friend who gently nudges me to do things I've listed. Popping the bubbles is VERY satisfying.","4 people found this review helpful","","","",""

Love popping bubbles and opening chests and watching the islands grow. My favorite feature is the unscheduled task bar, where i can pick from a collection of To-Dos.

Introduces a new form of checking your tasks with a realist and healthy approach when it comes to rewards. The vibe of the app is cozy and welcoming, so you really feel like doing your tasks but not with an addictive necessity, but just a normal and chill impulse.

I don't normally pay for apps, but after a really busy week with the free trial, I was sold. It's fun and light and makes me WANT to add tasks and think about my day ahead as well as return to check on my list. So glad I clicked over to this from the Forest app! Thanks, team.","","","","",""

The ability to prioritise all the tasks compared to just one high priority task currently available. 2. The ability to sync these tasks with Google Calendar.
