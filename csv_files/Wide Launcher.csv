Best part is that there is unrestricted customization. But one thing is missing that I am a Samsung Galaxy user and I am unable to use my android 10 navigation gesture. I suggest you and the team to kindly work on fixing this issue and provide a stable update with working navigation gesture. It would be a great help. Other than that everything is great and I think that this is the best launcher I have experienced on the play store at this time. Thank you.","298 people found this review helpful","Shouter Inc.","October 15, 2020","Hello. Thank you for the review.

A few things need improvement. For now, when I tick lock home screen, I expect nothing to move. Things are still moving. I was able to move an app icon from the dock into a folder in a palette. Also I would recommend to make the hold action on home screen customisable. Currently I can only see it selected as Main Menu. Thank you guys for the amazing launcher! Great job!","386 people found this review helpful","Shouter Inc.","March 16, 2022","Hello. Thank you for the review. I will forward your feedback to our team.","Show review history"

Wonderful app. Must to try. It might be a bit odd in the beginning considering the complete revamp of the functionality but you will get a hang of it very soon. Few improvements needed wrt functionalities like resizing of icons in launcher, grid arrangement on home pages, possibility of adding more home pages. Some cues can be taken from nova launcher.","375 people found this review helpful","","","",""

One thing though bothers me - when we place individual apps or folders (unless it's in a palette group) on the homescreen, the name/label of that app disappears. Wish there was an option to hide/unhide it. Also font support and ability to change the colour of the font and colour of app labels would be great.","45 people found this review helpful","Shouter Inc.","May 17, 2021","Hello.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 start is because it doesn't stay on my screen for long. I tried setting it as a default screen but still it returned back on it's original homescreen..

Like someone mentioned, ""we aren't exaggerating"". This is beyond the well, the frogs have leaped. Kudos to the team. P.s. Once upon a time there used to be an app called Buzz launcher then out of the bloom, it disappeared somehow from the play Store. Few peeps tried it again but in vain it was never the same.

Seems it's a compatibility w Google photos that was the issue. I know this only because the developer responded to my issue almost immediately. What's more is when initiating email correspondence w developer I was consistently and promptly responded to. Which I appreciate and it is a value that I respect in a business. Your suggestion to use another gallery instead worked If you can fix the compatibility issue so I can start using it w Google photos again it's be awesome!","5 people found this review helpful","Shouter Inc.","August 29, 2022","Hello.

It's smooth, easy to access, no ads which means it doesn't annoy you. Also it's so easy to customise and you can literally customise each and everything in this launcher.

But it got all the benefits I need. Look, performance, the flexibility to play with almost everything the way I can't remember seeing in any launcher before. I gave up on my root in Pixel 6 pro due to issues it gave me and functions I didn't manage to activate (e.g. auto call recording). Found the Wide Launcher and I'm happy with my ""new"" phone.
