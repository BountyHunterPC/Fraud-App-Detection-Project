Everything is working perfectly. But , I am having a little problem. The widget is not updating on real-time. Do fix it for me please. It's a very handy appüòá Edit - 12/10- The problem has been fixed. The new design is very satisfying. It looks good and pleasant. One thing is a little annoying though - usage/30 minutes- in that graph, we can't actually say how much time we have spent on that 30 minutes. It's because of that scaling system being used. Do have a look over it. It will be great, if the scaling is a little bit more data reflecting. I hope it's not asking a lot‚ò∫Ô∏è","28 people found this review helpful","Mindefy Labs","October 17, 2018","Thanks for the updated feedback Ansuman!

I have a couple of suggestions though. 1. The timer should only be shown in the apps we choose and not all of them. Also, remember position of the timer. Current default position is drawn over the menu button for some apps. 2. The block is too sudden if you are in middle of something. Make it fade to black or something for last 5 minutes as a warning or add a countdown timer.","33 people found this review helpful","Mindefy Labs","July 26, 2019","Hi,

After the completion of default time limit of 30 min for any app, it gives the option to extend it by 2 min or not remind again at all.

So, that if the phone is hot it changes to red and green for normal with date and timings on a graph and we can see when phone is used extensively and for better experience. I prefer this app over others and would like to have this feature for this app which other apps have like App usage!

Not only I use those time consuming apps cautiously but the reminder when it is going to near to closing is also great. And moreover it is not like it closes very adruptly but gives me some time to complete something I had been working on. Though it is simply painful to see the time I have spent on phone every 15 minutes or so. Also the no. Of times I simply open my phone to close it 6s later","","Mindefy Labs","August 26, 2020","Thanks for your review!

All the features that have been added has been more and more helpful. There is one feature I would like to be included i.e. the ability to change the daily usage notification in terms of the last day's usage time and not only percentage. I don't feel that percentage gives a better view of usage. So please include this. Thank you.","","Mindefy Labs","September 26, 2019","Dear User, Thank you for your suggestions.

Wish I could see the median or percentile score of all users as well to know how bad I am doing. But honestly, a very good application for insights and best part is it's not greedy like some others. I will buy this one in a month or so... since it's just one time payment, as a sign of gratitude. Thanks, dev team for this application. :) PS: Please fix your icon. I see the message you're trying to portray here, but it looks horrible, in contrast to your good UI.","23 people found this review helpful","Mindefy Labs","May 22, 2020","Thank you for providing your valuable feedback.

It's showing - ve seconds left (-600 seconds left). But it's supposed to be locked. App didn't serve the purpose. Kindly provide the patch. On the latest version of the application. Reason: Application is getting killed while clearing open apps. Though it has auto start permission and all other required permissions. Suggestion: add a page in settings listing all the permissions and their status.","30 people found this review helpful","Mindefy Labs","April 20, 2022","Hi, have you tried the latest update?

It doesn't have transparency setting it can only disappear for some time if double tapped that's it and now recently it is appearing bigger than usual. It's one of the most important feature and it's bothering pls add transparency option and resizing option for the floating timer.","","Mindefy Labs","June 4, 2021","Thank you for your kind feedback.
