After a few days I had to reinstall the app, I logged into my account, and now I have those ads back on again. I tried everything, but it stuck, so I cancelled my subscription. Although valid till July 2022. Worst possible experience.","3,545 people found this review helpful"

Looks like, now, after 3 days you have to pay to do anything. I've found some good ringtones & sounds. Sometimes results are the same thing over & over. Search results are sometimes irrelevant. Also, they're mostly parts of songs, which is great for ringtones. But even when I search for ""notification sounds"", I don't really get small/short tones or sounds in the results. I'd like to see more short sounds & different types of tones I can use just for notifications.","954 people found this review helpful"

However there has been some issues with the app in the past year. Normally I'd give five stars because i do love it. But even with an account there has been bugs with loading and lately it seems like the app has capped how much of my saved content is shown. When i go back to the item (ringtones, notification tones, wallpapers) the favorited icon still is clicked. Is it a glich or is it how it's programed.","92 people found this review helpful"

It has a large variety of content to decorate your phone. You will never get bored using this app. And of u don't have enough z credits u have an option to view an ad to get what u want.

Ignoring that this app is great, I can find almost anything I'm looking for, for notification sounds and wallpapers, it's truly amazing and very helpful. However the amount of ads makes it a pain to use which is why it's only 2 stars. There is an ad free version but I'm not about to pay money for it.","9 people found this review helpful"

Though I will admit finding things isn't easy. Like a certain wording or a wallpaper telling people to not touch the phone. But if you keep at it you can find something you like. Though the constant ads are annoying.","125 people found this review helpful"

Please fix this. There doesn't seem to be any updates atm. I uninstalled and reinstalled to see if it fixes it. But time will tell. If it fixes it. I'll come and give the 4 stars because well, I need to see this fix last more than a really short period of time. The last update was Oct and already the issue is back.

Now it's ACTUALLY unusable because 1. I tried to download a ringtone & it tells me to grant permission in settings... There is no option in settings or permissions, I've looked everywhere. The only permissions options are for Contacts, location, & notifications. And 2. Normally I don't mind ads because I understand devs need to make money but the amount of ads is.... Truly insane.","45 people found this review helpful"

One after another and it pushes their subscription constantly. It also glitches a lot and causes it to plays ads that you can't see so you can't mute them. Ads also randomly pop up and cause you to click on them when you were actually trying to click on a ringtone. The buttons to close them are so small. It's not worth having. At all. Selection of ringtones doesn't make up for everything else.","477 people found this review helpful"

If you click a sound even slightly wrong, BAM! Multiple full-screen ads. There's a difference between ""trying to monetize to cover development costs"" and ""too greedy to care"". Avoid this app at all costs. And a pre-emptive ""NO"" to your ""would you consider our ad-free subscription"" question. No! Absolutely not! You've proven yourselves too greedy to trust.","415 people found this review helpful"

Not just the normal amount. Excessive full page ads. Ads that won't show the close button until you clicked on its content. Also, they are stacked two at a time. I would recommend avoiding this app or uninstalling it immediately after downloading your wallpaper or ringtone to avoid tracking software.","293 people found this review helpful"

Download a wallpaper, watch an ad. Tinker with settings, watch an ad. I spent 3 minutes total in the app and had 5 ads. Also there's no way to use wallpapers already on my phone without uploading them for the world to use. I don't have the copyright to do that, so that's not an option.","1 person found this review helpful"

Used it once and it would put you in a loop of an ad and couldn't get out unless you closed all apps on your phone. Had it a few years ago and it caused all kinds of issues with the phone freezing etc. Once I uninstalled it before everything worked again properly. Figured I would give it another try. It is not usable unless you pay to not have ads....way too many. If you want an ad app, then download Zedge otherwise DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.","69 people found this review helpful"

This one is blatantly superior. It lets you search for video game sounds (I use Yoshi and Starcraft probe) and from a huge selection of images for your background. Easily the best wallpaper and ringtone/ notification sound app out there. Ads are minimal, too. Ringtones and sounds set easily and stay set.","40 people found this review helpful"

When you press the screen, it changes back to a previous wallpaper but not video just a picture of It.

It gave you exactly what you looked up. After the dumb amount of ads and possibility to have a ""premium"" account, it's just drowning you in literally ANY AND EVERYTHING that has to do with the words you're looking up. I would honestly rather make my own. It'd be a lot quicker than digging through this mess. I miss the way Zedge was.","27 people found this review helpful"

After you tap something to preview how it sounds, an ad will squeeze in underneath the thing you tapped and push the rest of the list down, making it really easy to accidentally tap the ad. Then there're the really long unskippable ads that will randomly pop up. Overall, very unpleasant experience and will be looking for alternatives now. Really disappointed it turned out like this.","76 people found this review helpful"

The only suggestion I have is it would be way better to have more song variety for music artist and genres. I like Nigerian music but there's not a huge selection for that group or music artist as others. Even if you had to pay for premium music like the others least it's an option to chose from if it was available.","36 people found this review helpful"

It's very user friendly. Been using it for years and is always one of the first apps I download on every new phone. Thanks so much, Zedge. Truly allows me to personalize my phone regardless of the mood I'm in or how much I want to change things up. Anything from contact ringtones to butterfly or lighthouse screensavers.

Occasional ads between posts would be ok but this is bonkers. Also, you can't even change the download location to a dedicated wallpaper folder. That's like the most basic functionality guys.

To download a wallpaper, you have to watch an ad. Not even a good app. Every time you open the app, or occasionally after having to sit through a long ad, they'll push their ""premium version"", which is basically the exact same app they had back in 2012. I'm assuming Zedge has been bought by some pigish corporation, because never before have I seen someone try to milk an honestly not that great app for all it's worth so hard.
