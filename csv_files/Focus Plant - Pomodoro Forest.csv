But I have been facing some issues. Earlier it was smooth & all good. But from last 2 months or so, when I choose to watch ads a blank screen appears & nothing happens. I had reinstalled the app, nothing happened. But now, after half a month I tried again after recieving developer's reply. Now its working well. Thanks for resolving the problem. And I am increasing the rating. This is a must try app. & has a lot in free of cost too","305 people found this review helpful","February 6, 2022","Hi, thank you for trying Focus Plant - pomodoro study timer to grow forest and flora.

It is an entire package of just what I wanted. Gamifying my focus sessions. Stopwatch. Timer. Pomodoro. Cute animation. And I can not pause the session however I want. I lose my rewards if I do not follow my planned schedule or if I open another app while the the sessions continue. This is great. Awesome. I am so glad I came across this. I recommend it to everyone who wishes not to stray off of their schedule. No popping of ads out of the blue.","110 people found this review helpful","May 5, 2022","Hi, thank you for using Focus Plant - pomodoro study timer to grow forest and flora.

Seems like there are plants and there are collectible cards of non-plants. Love the idea and graphics decent, ads totes optional so far. I'll give it a few more days and report back. One really annoying thing is you can't water all your raindrops at once. In level 1 plants, very irritating. The focus part itself and sounds are great!","73 people found this review helpful","November 15, 2022","Hi, thank you for trying Focus Plant - pomodoro study timer to grow forest and flora.

This app was probably one of the most helpful focus apps out there since there's no pressure for you to work for a long time, which really helped lengthen my short attention span, and the friend mode really motivated me to be productive.

I find it more useful and enjoyable than other similar apps. And since its free its even better. I try to watch some ads when i use it so to pay back the creators. Other apps that help you manage time give you a negative result when you can't finish your time session but here if you can't do it you are not ashamed and the only consequence is that your reward is not earned. One thing that bothers me is the pause button: it's too frictionless so it's really easy to loose focus.","25 people found this review helpful","August 20, 2022","Hi, thank you for trying Focus Plant - pomodoro study timer to grow forest and flora.

It makes me be productive because I want those cute plants to grow quickly. It really suits me and my taste. Thanks for creating such a lovely and practical app. I couldn't find the ""pause"" option when I used the pomodoro mode. It will be great if you add it. I created a group there and went awwww :"")","2 people found this review helpful","August 20, 2022","Hi, thank you for using Focus Plant - pomodoro study timer to grow forest and flora.

The raindrop cost is quite low at the beginning as it is designed to ease the early learning curve and the raindrop consumption increases as you progress. Hope we can help with your study, productivity and to-do!"

I have reduced my time on my phone significantly and I only check it every hour or so now. I used to check it multiple times an hour.
