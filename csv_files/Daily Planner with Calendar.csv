Very visual and I love that there is a simple diary view too to keep track of daily priorities/reflections. Suggestions: 1. Make easier to make/edit categories (""event title"") and reflect edit changes in graph. 2. Sometimes words overlap on pie. 3. I don't like how it makes android top bar (current time etc) disappear. 4.

My only complaint is not being able to change font color and size on the graph, it can be really hard to read the writing.","9 people found this review helpful","Kiyoh Inc.","December 11, 2021","Thank you very much for your kindness.

In addition, please add Persian and Arabic language support. 🙏 You are the BEST.","6 people found this review helpful","Kiyoh Inc.","January 5, 2022","Thank you very much for your kindness.

The only thing I don't see is a good birds eye view over a period of time. It would be nice if the total screen could be viewed over different time periods (week, month, quarter, year).","6 people found this review helpful","Kiyoh Inc.","August 7, 2021","Thank you very much for your kindness.
