But the experience has been a nightmare for the past several months. When I click on the excel files it doesn't open, in the past it used to open when I click on ""open with"". That also doesn't work anymore. It's intriguing, I don't if you can fix this. I updated the app - some paid options have come up, but same result! Oh god, are you listening ?","683 people found this review helpful",""

The issue with this app is that it lags a lot, and opens new windows (if that's the word to use in Android) for each file and slows down the system. The developers need to made this more subtle while keeping the facilities intact. Otherwise not too bad.","694 people found this review helpful",""

Otherwise its Too good, easy access and use for viewing, securing and storage of official documents and data. Even personal documents and data feels safely secured and easy to access as and when required. Making and saving a document, or sharing it on other platform through various online channels, etc is all very good. You won't regret once you start using this one in all app.","2,604 people found this review helpful",""

As someone who writes a certain word count per day, this makes the app useless for me. I have to go out of my way to see my proguess instead of having it displayed right there. What does character count do for me? Nothing. This is not the case with the desktop app, so it baffles me that they force something so useless on you in the app. I want to se the real live word count, not full text! The file sync is a mess too, useless.","6 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

When I create a table and fill it with text first before typing some more text on the blank page, every time the text cannot move to the top of the table. Remains only on the left side of the second page. Then an attempt to move the table and its contents is even worse. By the time I try to paste, only the contents will display. There will be no table. And, the text wrapping function is ineffective. Please fix it.","139 people found this review helpful",""

And now for the adverse. I clearly understand the need to monetize an app. But as soon as you open the app WPS assaults you with premium features in order for you to upgrade. When saving a document sometimes, it is difficult to determine what the default folder is ( but I think that this could be partially attributed to changes in Android since version 9 )","218 people found this review helpful",""

It really works smoothly in my device, and I've never experienced major bugs in the app. However, if I compare to Office products, WPS Office lacks of features, and it can barely detect font style, especially those that aren't used often. It sometimes faces difficulty when opening .doc files, but most of the time, it can open .doc files.","425 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

If I do not realize it is an older version of the document, I save it, and I lose all the work I was working on. Also, the content of random cells kept getting replaced by random text from other cells.","506 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

I use Excel daily to manage jobs and work orders. I have always had problems saving the file. If I save it with a new filename and edit the file then go to another program and come back to WPS it will load the old file name and lose all the changes I made. I need to fully close the app then open the new file. Even when I do that it can still lose everything.

I like that you can put together written letters/ reports, presentations, spreadsheets and a lot more all on the same application. The document scan, picture-to-PDF option does come in handy, although it comes fully with the premium version.

The menu is constantly open. This means on a tablet you can easily accidentally touch a setting in the exposed menu and change something on the page: leaving you to guess what you just accidentally brushed a finger over. Also reduces the amount of page view.","194 people found this review helpful","Show review history"
