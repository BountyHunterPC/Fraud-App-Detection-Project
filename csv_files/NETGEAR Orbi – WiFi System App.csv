However this morning(24 Dec 2020) I find the app shows my satellite to be offline, I did all the troubleshooting as described in the manual only to find that when I login to the router management page from my laptop there wasn't any issue at all to begin with! Seems like a bug in the app. I do intend to write to the email address provided here with the screenshots.","25 people found this review helpful",""

With the update that just came in today everything is working perfectly again - I'm able to login. Despite having deleted the app and reinstalled a few times in my troubleshooting; when I logged in the updated app it picked up everything just how I initially had it set. If you still have the ""timeout"" error; ensure you've updated to the latest app version. Here's hoping we don't have to experience login issues again in future updates.","2 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

This is my second day with the app. I was able to set up the network very easily. It then downloaded all the available firmware updates for the router. So far, I'm happy. 4 Nov 2022 Update -- Like many other users, the app suddenly encountered a problem. It requests a new sign in, then says it has timed out and refuses to run. Rebooting the router doesn't help, neither does deleting and reinstalling the app. The hardware works fine, but the app is pretty useless.","85 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

No firmware updates, no speed test. Absolutely useless and can't get customer support anymore since my warranty expired, all you can do is look through posts to try and find a solution. Even going through the computer trying to login in to the router the pages won't load. Guess it's time to find a different mesh system that takes care of their customers.","1 person found this review helpful",""

Reoccurring silly login errors from more than 2 years ago. If simple remote management via a convenient app is what you seek, Do Not Purchase the Orbi products until they solve their issues. If you don't care about the app, then the hardware seems to be some of the best I've experienced over the past 30+ years.

After the 1.5 year the system doesn’t work. If you get a hold of tech support who continues to have network issues, they will make you master reset. Tech support can be very rude with background noise. There's no answer as to why I have had to master reset this system so many times. Tell me what the root of the problem is because it goes off line, or I can't access from the mobile app, or it won't download the malware that I purchased directly from Netgear.","",""

No way to control our wifi now. I've waited over a week for any update from the company to no avail. Maybe this type if review will expedite the fix and improve their lack of QA. Yes, there have been suggested things to ""try"".. reinstalling the app, reboot the router and use of the anywhere option. They do not fix this issue or even offer a work around.

Very frustrating as lots of features are not availble on app as compared to browser login. Also, Netgear is a bunch of scam artists now, pay out the nose for new router only to be told its $149.99 to talk to a service representative if your having any issues! They recently added parental controls to the router but put it behind a subscription fee!","55 people found this review helpful","Show review history"

Had to install it to get my orbi system started. Couple of hiccups at first, ok no big deal it got up and running. Then we decided to rename the network due to intrusion on the network. Now app is stuck in this eternal loop of admin password timeout error. Had to perform all setup features and tasks via website, fortunately that works.
