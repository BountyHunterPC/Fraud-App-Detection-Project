This time it is the ability to set a duration of an event/ task. Except this everything is present. Gorgeous UI, lots of different option while creating tasks. And above all it offers an one time payment option(as far as I remember) which is the deal sealer for me. If only this had option to set start and ending time of event. Oh well! Edit:I'll definitely wait when u add the feature.","16 people found this review helpful","ULSoft","June 3, 2022","Thank you for your feedback! ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§óü§ó At the moment you can do the following: When editing a task go to Timer and Duration if you need to set up duration for the task.

But I have one recommendation, if it's possible to make different tab for habits excluding the other recurring tasks, it would be more clear and functional. Keeping habits and other recurring tasks at the same place sometimes seems overwhelming when you check on what habits you need to perform that day.","7 people found this review helpful","ULSoft","May 26, 2022","Thank you for your feedback!

I like how it has multiple settings to customize my own experience and has a really nice and cute interface. The reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it doesn't have much sound. For eaxmple, when I complete a task I would have liked to hear a satisfying ""cleeng"" sound not just a turning page sound that plays for every kind of status change. The same could be said for achievements.","4 people found this review helpful","ULSoft","November 3, 2022","Thank you so much for your feedback! ü§óü§ó We added your idea to our list of suggestion!

In addition to the regular recurring task settings such as daily, weekly, yearly and every so many days, weeks etc you've got floating due dates. This is fantastic because let's face it no schedule is ever the same every week and sometimes you just gotta do things at some point during the week or so. Also if a task does have a fixed day of the week for example it's really easy to reschedule a single instance to another day.","1 person found this review helpful","ULSoft","September 8, 2022","Thank you for your feedback, Linn√©a Sara Jenner! ü§ó We are doing our best to make our users happy and pleased!

I use it to plan and keep track of the progress of the exercises I need to do to get better after years of illness. The UI is easy to understand, nice introduction if you want it. Clean, not noisy at all so also good for most ppl with autism, brain injury, sensory overload etc I think. The free version is enough, would have bought the premium immediately if it were affordable, like ‚Ç¨10-15 max. Now it's just way too expensive. Give me a nudge on black Friday please üòâ","1 person found this review helpful","ULSoft","November 18, 2021","Thank you for your feedback, Carlijn!

It most importantly has a feature that I've found missing on so many other habit apps that I've tried - the ability to set a variable number for ""times a day."" If apps let you set a goal for multiple times, it tends to be all or nothing. With this, I can still check off the task whether I managed 1 or 10. I only wish that the x/y that you can see before you mark the task as completed was available to afterward. That's data that I'd love to be able to track on a long term basis. This also applies for the subtasks. You can check them off, but they don't remain checked when you look back at previous days. This is still a really solid app.","53 people found this review helpful","ULSoft","June 19, 2021","Thank you for your suggestions Justine! We plan to add more detailed statistics, including subtasks and repetitions per day. This functionality will appear after a while."

Sure you can create one-time events, but once the day finishes they're removed from view, forever to be lost in the depths of the ""all tasks"" tab. This makes the app pretty much useless to keep an eye on things you need to do but don't have an specific date tied to them.","24 people found this review helpful","ULSoft","May 19, 2021","Hello Alexandra! We've added an option for one-time tasks - show it on calendar until it's done. Please, update the app!"

This has the features I've been looking for (if not exactly the feature, very close to it!), and it's a plus that I can create more than 5 habits even in the free version, so thanks for that! Definitely will be upgrading to the Premium version soon because the main extra feature I like is the ability to add notes to each habit every day. Would love the ability to put a habit ""on pause"" though or something similar, like when there might be a month or two when I can't do one.","25 people found this review helpful","ULSoft","April 14, 2021","Thank you very much for the feedback Ahliesa! We are working on the ""pause"" feature and will release it in ~2 weeks."
