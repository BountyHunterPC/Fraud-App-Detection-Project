The only thing I would wish to have and probably the reason for one less star is text parsing. Right now only the date and label gets parsed. It would be great if it could parse the name of the list, the priority, and other things! Lastly, another feature I would love to see is to be able to see my tasks in another calendar application too. The calendar support as of now is limited to within the application","18 people found this review helpful"

The app interface is very minimalistic and easy to use. The features on this app is insane! I was searching for todo list apps with in built pomodoro timer and this has it. Best part it has weekly view(free) & calendar view(only premium users)! And the windows app is also smooth and it has a floating timer. Great work by app developer's! I 100% recommend it!","18 people found this review helpful"

I'm giving just 3 stars because of one major issue I'm facing. I am not getting notifications for my reminders consistently, even though I followed all the steps provided by the app. Team pls fix this issue because sending timely notifications is one of the most important feature when it comes to productivity.","8 people found this review helpful"

I would like to put in details myself for each repeated copy and make them easily identifiable when I go look for when I did what or in case I miss one task, I know exactly what I was supposed to be doing the last day. Hope the developers look into it. Thanks","28 people found this review helpful"

Loved the widget settings, specially where you can tick off the completed tasks. Also the categorisation of tasks under multiple list tabs like work, personal, health, etc is wonderful. I need the app for habit tracking too but it doesn't track more than 5 habits, requires premium version for it. 5 is so less, maybe 10 could have been better.","41 people found this review helpful"

I have been a free user, and couldn't resist upgrading to premium. I did, but it lacks one feature. It doesn't have a feature of repeatedly reminding for habits. For example, if I want to set a goal of drinking water 8 glasses a day. It should remind me after consecutive 2 hours maybe, this way this app would have no match.","4 people found this review helpful"

It is extremely helpful for me to combat my procrastination. Everytime I unlock my phone it's the first thing I see and it forces me to get more things done. Also really useful for a day planner and the app has a multitude of features that makes it useful everyone. One downside I have found is that the app is at first hard to navigate and it can be difficult to understand all the functions. Perhaps a small guide would help.","30 people found this review helpful"

The free version in and of itself is so good with it's tasks and subtasks and reminders etc. The paid version gives you a calendar which is very intuitive and simple. The only problem I have with tick tick is that I want instant syncing. So instant that when I tick off a task in the phone, it should instantly reflect in the pc. And for some inexplicable reason, that's not there yet.","112 people found this review helpful"

Here are the reasons: 1. The UI is simple and intuitive. Don't need tutorials to understand unless you really want to dig into it. 2. The free plan they have is pretty decent and even offers reminders and integrations which I wasn't able to find in other apps ( I've tried about 12 - 13) 3.

Just makes doing and completing tasks easily. Highly customizable to the minutest details in setting reminders, to do lists and even in recurring reminders. Recurring reminders are absolutely the best in TickTick. Another great feature is if you don't want tasks of a particular tag to not show up in the daily task list, that too is an option.

Working with it in the background is not bothering either. It has a great Pomodoro timer as well. The reminders do seek a lot of attention, and one can't go to another app while the reminders are coming up. Other than that I would recommend it to everyone trying to work with a complicated or large schedule. No bothering adds or app begging for premium either, which is great!","71 people found this review helpful"

Very good for visual thinkers - dragging tasks onto the calendar view is fantastic. The only star dropped is due to some calendar syncing issues, which seem to have been resolved, although some events can take a few hours to leave the TickTick calendar after deletion in Outlook, for example. Thank you for a great productivity tool.","3 people found this review helpful"

I don't mind paying a one-off fee for an app, but a subscription of $30 a year to maintain a to-do list app is highway robbery. I can't even see a calendar view without paying. Not to mention it can be fiddly as hell, and I'm a UX designer... I'm uninstalling.","3 people found this review helpful"

Without subscription, you can sync reliably across multiple platforms (as someone that uses apple, windows and android, this is a big üëç) and even use features like pomodoro and habits tracker.

I'm using the free version and still the amount of quality features are incredible. The whole app screams minimalistic and easy to use. The pomodoro functionality alone deserves a 5 star.

But what makes it unusable for me is that you cannot sort the Completed Items in lists. So, if you want to buy some item again, you need to search and scroll down the entire list of Completed Items to find it. This is really bothering. Alphabetically would be much faster and make more sense.","5 people found this review helpful"

The only thing missing is a Due-like (Apple only) ability to issue annoying notifications. With TickTick, you get one notification. If you're not near your phone, you won't know you've missed a task until next time you pick up your phone. It'd be great if TickTick would issue a *new* notification every X minutes (user-controlled) until you acknowledge, so that you never miss a notification.","14 people found this review helpful"

Biggest flaw is lack of sorting or management of checked off items. When you mark eggs off your shopping list, you have to hunt through the checked items to find out again later, when an alphabetized list would make it so efficient. Our you just add eggs again to the point you eventually have eggs in the completed list 7 times. That problem alone is serious enough for me to drop 2 stars off. Fix that and I'd rate it a 5.","10 people found this review helpful"
